The apparatus of claim 1 wherein a portion of said lower surface of said upper support member abuts against a portion of at least one upper surface of said track of said mounting plate and a portion of said screw abuts against an internal surface of said track when said screw is fully engaged with said upper support member. 5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said track comprises a first wall and a second wall, and wherein the head of said screw comprises a first flat radial surface and a second flat radial surface, and wherein first and second flat radial surfaces are in parallel and separated by a distance less than the distance between the first and second walls. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein a distance from a first edge of the first flat radial surface to a first edge of the second flat radial surface is less than the distance between the first and second walls, and wherein a distance from the first edge of the first flat radial surface to a second edge of the second flat radial surface is greater than the distance between the first and second walls. 7. The apparatus of claim 1 further including a flashing, said flashing fitting around said upper support member. 8. A support apparatus for securing a load to a roof comprising: a mounting plate, said mounting plate comprising, a base, and a track extending parallel to said base and protruding upward from said base, said track having a first wall and a second wall, said first and second wall defining a width of a cavity, said first wall having a first internal surface perpendicular to said base and a second internal surface parallel with said base, said second wall having a first internal surface perpendicular to said base and a second internal surface parallel with said base, said first internal surface of said first wall facing said first internal surface of said second wall; a screw comprising a head and a threaded shaft; and a post having a first end including a threaded hole for receiving said threaded shaft of said screw; wherein the width of the cavity is less than a first diameter of said head of said screw and is greater than a second diameter of said head such that said head may travel down said track within said cavity without said head being able to rotate. 9. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said first wall includes an end surface and said second wall includes an end surface, said end surface of said first wall facing said end surface of said second wall, wherein a distance between said end surface of said first wall and said end surface of said second wall is greater than a diameter of the shaft of said screw to allow said screw to travel horizontally down said track, and wherein the distance between said end surface of said first wall and said end surface of said second wall is less than any radial distance between opposite sides of said head of said screw to prevent said screw from being vertically removed from the cavity of the track. 10. The apparatus of claim 9 wherein said track further includes an intermediate plate extending parallel with said base and bridging a portion of said first wall with said second wall, said intermediate plate defining a lower bound of said cavity and providing a planar surface such that said screw may lie head down and perpendicular to said base. 11. The apparatus of claim 10 wherein a height between an upper surface of said intermediate plate and said second internal surface of said first wall matches a second height between said upper surface of said intermediate plate and said second internal surface of said second wall, said height being greater than a thickness of said head of said screw to allow movement of said head of said screw along said track when said screw is not fully engaged to said upper support member. 12. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said mounting plate has a length greater than a width of said mounting plate and said mounting plate is made of a solid piece of elongated material. 13. The apparatus of claim 12 wherein the width of said base is greater than the width of said track. 14. The apparatus of claim 13 wherein the base comprises a first exposed surface adjacent to a first side of said track and a second exposed surface adjacent to a second side of said track. 15. The apparatus of claim 14 wherein the base comprises one or more holes on each side of said track for attaching said mounting plate to a surface of a roof. 16. The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising a flashing, said flashing fitting around said post support member. 17. A method for securing a load to a roof, said method comprising: engaging a mounting plate on an upper surface of said roof, said mounting plate comprising elongated base and a track extending parallel to said base, wherein said track extends upward from said base, said base having a width greater than a width of said track and forming a first exposed surface adjacent to a first side of said track and a second exposed surface adjacent to a second side of said track; attaching a first attachment member through said first exposed surface into said roof to attach said mounting plate to said roof, said first attachment member having a first portion attached to a supporting rafter in said roof, and a second portion abut against said first exposed surface when said first portion is attached; attaching a second attachment member through said second exposed surface into said roof to attach said mounting plate to said roof, said second attachment member having a first portion attached to the rafter in said roof, and a second portion abut against said second exposed surface when said first portion is attached; inserting a head of a screw into said track, wherein a threaded shaft of said screw is exposed above said track at a location corresponding to a predetermined mounting position on said roof a perpendicular distance from said rafter; creating an opening in a roof covering material at said predetermine mounting position; attaching an upper support member through the opening in said covering material to said screw, said upper support member having an elongated shape, an upper surface, and a lower surface, said lower surface including a threaded hole for engaging said threaded shaft of said screw; and attaching said load to said upper surface of said upper support member. 18. The method of claim 17 further comprising adding a flashing to an exposed portion of said upper support member above said roof covering material, wherein the roof covering material is tile. 19. The method of claim 17 wherein attaching said load to said support member includes screwing a second screw into a second tapped hole of said upper support member, said second tapped hole penetrating said upper surface of said upper support member. 20. The method of claim 17 wherein attaching an upper support member includes tightening said upper support member onto said screw such that said lower surface of said upper support member abuts against at least one upper surface of said track of said mounting plate and a portion of said screw abuts against at least one portion of at least one internal surface of said track.
