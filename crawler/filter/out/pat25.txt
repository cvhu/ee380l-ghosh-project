A wireless meter-reading system includes a utility meter having a housing and a face and a recording device located in the housing. The recording device is adapted to read and convert data located on a portion of the face to wirelessly transmittable data. A power source coupled to the recording device permits continuous and instantaneous capture of the wirelessly transmittable data from the face of the utility meter by the recording device. A communication device provided for wirelessly receiving and transmitting data between a consumer site and a utility provider site facilitates monitoring of the face of the utility meter by the consumer site and by the utility provider site. A method for allowing a consumer to join a secured wireless network of a utility provider comprises the consumer paying a fee to the utility provider. Both the consumer and the utility provider benefit from this arrangement.Claims What is claimed is: 1.
