A shingle system, mountable to a support surface, includes overlapping shingle assemblies. Each shingle assembly comprises a support bracket, having upper and lower ends, secured to a shingle body. The upper end has an upper support portion, extending away from the shingle body, and an upper support-surface-engaging part, engageable with a support surface so that the upper edge of the shingle body is positionable at a first distance from the support surface to create a first gap therebetween. The lower end has a lower support portion extending away from the lower surface. The support brackets create: (1) a second gap between shingle bodies of the first and second shingle assemblies, and (2) an open region beneath the first shingle assembly fluidly coupling the first and second gaps.Claims The invention claimed is: 1.

The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein at least one of the shingle assemblies comprises a photovoltaic (PV) shingle assembly. 3. The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein the support bracket comprises a middle portion connecting the upper and lower ends. 4. The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein the lower end of the support bracket engages the lower edge of the shingle body. 5. The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein the lower end of the support bracket comprises a clip engaging the lower edge of the shingle body. 6. The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein each of the first and second shingle assemblies comprises first and second of said support brackets, said first and second support brackets being laterally spaced apart. 7. The shingle system according to claim 1 wherein the support bracket is spaced apart from the first and second side edges. 8. The shingle system according to claim 1 further comprising an air-permeable rain infiltration barrier positioned within the second gap. 9. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the opening in the tab extends parallel to the lower edge of the shingle body and the engagement element extends perpendicular to the lower edge of the shingle body. 10. The assembly according to claim 1 wherein the upper support-surface-engaging part of the first shingle assembly comprises a support surface-engaging fastener, the support surface-engaging fastener being free from overlying structure of the first shingle assembly. 11. A building surface assembly comprising: a building surface; first, upper and second, lower shingle assemblies mounted to the building surface, each of the first and second shingle assemblies comprising: a support bracket; a shingle body comprising an upper surface, a lower surface, and upper and lower edges connected by first and second side edges, the shingle body secured to the first and second support brackets; the support bracket comprising: upper and lower ends; the upper end having an upper support portion extending away from the lower surface, the upper support portion having an upper support-surface-engaging part secured to the building surface using a fastener extending into the building surface so that the upper edge of the shingle body is positioned at a first distance from the building surface to create a first gap therebetween; the fastener of the upper support-surface-engaging part of the first shingle assembly being free from overlying structure of the first shingle assembly; and the lower end having a lower support portion extending away from the lower surface; a portion of the shingle body along the lower edge of the first shingle assembly overlying a portion of the shingle body along the upper edge of the second shingle assembly so that the first and second shingle assemblies overlap one another; the lower support portion of the support bracket of the first shingle assembly engageable with the second shingle assembly so to position the lower edge of the shingle body of the first shingle assembly spaced apart from the upper surface of the shingle body of the second shingle assembly to create: (1) a second gap between the lower surface of the shingle body of the first shingle assembly and the upper surface of the shingle body of the second shingle assembly, and (2) an open region beneath the first shingle assembly fluidly coupling the first and second gaps; a chosen one of (1) the lower end of the support bracket of the first shingle assembly and (2) the upper end of the support bracket of the second shingle assembly, comprising a tab extending downwardly away from the shingle body of the first shingle assembly to a position below the upper surface of the shingle body of the second shingle assembly, the tab having an opening formed therein; and the upper end of the support bracket of the other of the (1) the lower end of the support bracket of the first shingle assembly and (2) the upper end of the support bracket of the second shingle assembly, comprising an engagement element engaged within said opening to be completely encircled by said opening. 12. The assembly according to claim 11 wherein at least one of the shingle assemblies comprises a photovoltaic (PY) shingle assembly. 13. The shingle assembly according to claim 11 wherein each of the first and second shingle assemblies comprises first and second of said support brackets, said first and second support brackets being laterally spaced apart. 14.
