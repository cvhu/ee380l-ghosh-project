A distributed power generation system enabled for assured reliability comprises a direct current power source, a direct current to alternating current converter (DTAC), electrically coupled to the direct current power source, the DTAC comprising a reliability limiting component (RLC) and a sensor for sensing a measurable parameter of the RLC. A decision engine is communicatively coupled to the sensor, and is operable to determine a lifetime estimate for the RLC based on the measurable parameter. A service provider is communicatively coupled to the decision engine by a communication system to receive a signal communicating the lifetime estimate. The service provider schedules preventative maintenance based on the signal communicating the lifetime estimate.Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A distributed power generation system enabled for assured reliability comprising: a direct current power source; a direct current to alternating current converter (DTAC) electrically coupled to said direct current power source, said DTAC comprising a reliability limiting component (RLC) and a sensor for sensing a measurable parameter of said RLC; a decision engine communicatively coupled to said sensor, said decision engine operable to determine a lifetime estimate for said RLC based on said measurable parameter; and a service provider communicatively coupled to said decision engine by a communication system to receive a signal communicating said lifetime estimate, said service provider scheduling preventative maintenance based on said signal communicating said lifetime estimate. 2. The system of claim 1 wherein said RLC comprises a capacitor. 3. The system of claim 2 wherein said sensor measures a voltage drop across said capacitor. 4. The system of claim 2 wherein said sensor measures a frequency of a ripple current of said capacitor. 5. The system of claim 2 wherein said sensor measures a current flowing out of said capacitor. 6. The system of claim 2 wherein said sensor measures a temperature of said capacitor. 7. The system of claim 1 wherein said RLC comprises a power switch. 8. The system of claim 7 wherein said sensor measures a voltage across said power switch. 9. The system of claim 7 wherein said sensor measures a temperature of said power switch. 10. The system of claim 1 wherein said power switch is selected from the group consisting of an integrated-gate insulated transistor, a field effect transistor, a gate turnoff device and an emitter turn-off device. 11. The system of claim 1 wherein said direct current power source comprises a photovoltaic (PV) system. 12. The system of claim 1 wherein said RLC comprises an inverter for photovoltaics. 13. The system of claim 11 wherein said service provider schedules said preventive maintenance in off-daylight hours. 14. The system of claim 1 wherein said direct current power source comprises a microturbine. 15. The system of claim 14 wherein said service provider is not an integrator/installer of said direct current power source. 16. The system of claim 1 wherein said direct current power source is installed for a non-commercial customer. 17. The system of claim 1 wherein said decision engine is co-located with said DTAC. 18. The system of claim 1 wherein said communication system comprises a large area network (LAN). 19. The system of claim 1 wherein said service provider make use of a just-in-time RLC replacement scheme. 20. The system of claim 1 wherein said decision engine provides said signal to said service provider when said lifetime estimate of said RLC is less than twenty percent.
