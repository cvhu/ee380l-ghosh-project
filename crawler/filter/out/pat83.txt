The specification and drawing figures describe and show a low profile mounting system that includes a at least one rail. A plurality of tracks is formed in the rail with opposing jaws. The opposing jaws define a slot. The opposing jaws are disposed in the rail asymmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the rail. At least one ledge monolithically extends from the rail for holding an object such as a solar panel. A coupler is provided for demountably connecting a solar panel to the rail. A cleat also is provided for attaching the system to a surface. A connector connects the rail to the cleat. This abstract is provided to comply with rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher or other reader to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure, but this abstract is not to be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of any claim.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method for manufacturing and installing a mounting system with solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices, comprising: configuring a material into at least one rail; shaping the rail to include a plurality of tracks formed in the rail with opposing jaws defining a slot, wherein at least two of the plurality of tracks formed perpendicularly to one another, and further wherein the opposing jaws are disposed in the at least one rail asymmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the at least one rail; including at least one ledge extending from the rail; providing at least one coupler, the at least one coupler comprising at least one clamp, and at least one attachment device, and the at least one ledge and at least one coupler configured to receive and secure the solar panel, photovoltaic device or solar energy device; including at least one end plate; means for connecting the at least one rail to a surface, and installing the solar panel, photovoltaic device or solar energy device on the at least one ledge. 2. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the means for connecting consist of at least one of: a nut, a bolt, a stanchion, and a cleat. 3. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the means for connecting are slidably insertable into at least one of the plurality of tracks. 4. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the attachment device is at least one of a bolt, a nut, threaded rods, rivets and screws. 5. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the rail further comprises opposing fins; and further wherein the attachment device is a screw, the screw held in place in part by the opposing fins. 6. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the configured rail further comprises at least one detent, the at least one detent configured to receive a portion of the clamp. 7. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the included ledge extends from the at least one rail at substantially a right angle. 8. The method for manufacturing a mounting system for solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices of claim 1, wherein the attachment device is formed to be slidably insertable into at least one of the plurality of tracks. 9. A method for manufacturing and installing a mounting system with solar panels, photovoltaic devices or solar energy devices, comprising: configuring a material into at least one rail formed with a plurality of tracks, shaping the rail so that at least two of the plurality of tracks are formed perpendicularly to one another, wherein a plurality of slots defined within the plurality of tracks by a pair opposing jaws, and further wherein the opposing jaws disposed in the at least one rail asymmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the at least one rail; providing at least one coupler, the coupler including at least one clamp and at least one first attachment device, wherein the rail is secured to the frame of at least one solar panel; including at least one ledge extending substantially perpendicularly from the rail; and including at least one second attachment device, the second attachment device configured to secure the rail to a surface, and installing the solar panel by securing a frame member of the solar panel, photovoltaic device or solar energy device to the rail. 10. A method for manufacturing and installing a mounting system with a solar panel on a surface comprising: configuring a material into a rail; shaping the rail to include a plurality of tracks, the tracks including a slot defined by opposing jaws, and at least two of the tracks disposed perpendicularly to one another; including at least one ledge extending perpendicularly from the rail; providing a coupler, the coupler including at least clamp and at least one first attachment device, and including at least one second attachment device, at least one track being slidably engageable with the second attachment device, and the second attachment device including means to couple to the rail to a surface, and installing the solar panel, wherein the first attachment device secures at least one solar panel frame to the rail.
