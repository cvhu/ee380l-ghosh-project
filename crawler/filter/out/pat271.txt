A photovoltaic (PV) module assembly including a PV module, a deflector, and a clip. The PV module includes a PV device and a frame. A PV laminate is assembled to the frame, and the frame includes a support arm forming a seat. The deflector defines a front face and a rear face, with the clip extending from either the trailing frame member or the rear face of the deflector. In a mounted state, the deflector is nested within the seat and is releasably mounted to the trailing frame member via the clip. In some embodiments, the support arm forms a second seat, with the PV module assembly providing a second mounted state in which the deflector is in a differing orientation/slope, nested within the second seat and releasably mounted to the trailing frame member via the clip.Claims What is claimed is: 1.

The assembly of claim 1, wherein the frame includes a second support arm extending from the framework and beyond the trailing frame member, the second support arm forming a third seat that is laterally aligned with the first seat of the first support arm and configured to frictionally receive a portion of the deflector. 11. The assembly of claim 1, wherein the clip projects from the trailing frame member and forms a retention section, and further wherein the deflector forms a first receptacle at the rear face sized to receive the retention section in the first mounted state. 12. The assembly of claim 11, wherein the retention section is deflectable from a natural position having a first outer dimension to a deflected position having a second outer dimension less than the first outer dimension, the retention section exhibiting a natural bias from the deflected position toward the natural position, and further wherein the first receptacle is defined by at least one wall member positioned to force the retention section to the deflection position upon insertion of the retention section into the first receptacle in the first mounted state. 13. The assembly of claim 12, wherein the clip further includes: a leg projecting from one of the trailing frame member and the rear face of the deflector, the leg adapted to limit vibration of the deflector in the first mounted state. 14. The assembly of claim 1, wherein an entirety of the deflector is plastic and an entirety of the framework is plastic. 15. A photovoltaic module assembly for non-penetrating installation to a substantially flat surface, the assembly comprising: a photovoltaic module including: a device including a photovoltaic laminate, a frame assembled to the photovoltaic laminate, the frame including: framework encompassing a perimeter of the photovoltaic laminate and having a trailing frame member, a first support arm extending from the framework and beyond the trailing frame member, the first support arm forming a first seat; a deflector defining a front face and a rear face; and a clip extending from one of the frame and the rear face of the deflector; wherein the assembly is configured to provide a first mounted state in which the deflector is nested within the first seat and is releasably mounted to the trailing frame member via the clip, wherein the clip projects from the trailing frame member and forms a retention section, and further wherein the deflector forms a first receptacle at the rear face sized to receive the retention section in the first mounted state, and wherein the retention section is deflectable from a natural position having a first outer dimension to a deflected position having a second outer dimension less than the first outer dimension, the retention section exhibiting a natural bias from the deflected position toward the natural position, and further wherein the first receptacle is defined by at least one wall member positioned to force the retention section to the deflection position upon insertion of the retention section into the first receptacle in the first mounted state. 16.
