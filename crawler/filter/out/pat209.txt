A junction box for a photovoltaic system includes a housing having a base and a cover removably attached thereto, and a plurality of guide channels extending from an exterior surface of the housing to an interior portion thereof. The guide channels are sized and shaped to receive a plurality of conductive foil strips from a solar panel array. When the strips are fed into the guide channels, they are guided to and properly positioned within corresponding receptacles. Each receptacle is sized and shaped to receive a buss bar, and each strip is connected to a corresponding buss bar by a low insertion connector. When the cover is fully engaged with the base, bosses extending from the cover press against the connectors, creating a spring tension and pinch and retain the associated strip. As a result, a reliable physical and electrical connection between the strips and the buss bars is achieved. A heat sink having a plurality of fins protrude outwardly from the housing to dissipate heat externally.Claims We claim: 1.

The electrical junction box of claim 1, wherein each of said plurality of guide channels includes guiding means, located between said inner and outer ends of said guide channel, for guiding the electrical conductor from a first direction to a second direction different from said first direction. 3. The electrical junction box of claim 2, wherein said first and second directions are substantially perpendicular to one another. 4. The electrical junction box of claim 1, further comprising first connecting means for electrically connecting said plurality of buss bars to one another. 5. The electrical junction box of claim 4, wherein said first connecting means includes at least one diode. 6. The electrical junction box of claim 5, wherein said at least one diode includes a plurality of diodes. 7. The electrical junction box of claim 6, further comprising a heat sink mounted to said housing, said heat sink including a mounting portion positioned within said interior portion of said housing and a plurality of fins extending from said mounting portion and protruding externally from said housing, and said plurality of diodes being mounted to said mounting portion of said heat sink. 8. The electrical junction box of claim 1, further comprising second connecting means for connecting each of the plurality of foil strips to a corresponding one of said plurality of buss bars. 9. The electrical junction box of claim 8, wherein said second connecting means includes a plurality of electrical connectors, each of the plurality of foil strips being connectable to a corresponding one of said plurality of buss bars by a corresponding one of said plurality of electrical connectors. 10. The electrical junction box of claim 9, wherein said plurality of electrical connectors includes a plurality of low insertion connectors. 11. The electrical junction box of claim 10, wherein said housing includes a base and a cover, said base including a first end and a second end opposite said first end, said cover being removably attached to said first end of said base, said outer ends of said plurality of guide channels being located at said second end of said base. 12. The electrical junction box of claim 11, wherein said cover includes an interior surface and a plurality of boss members extending from said interior surface of said cover, whereby when said cover is attached to said base, each of said plurality of boss members is urged against a corresponding one of said plurality of low insertion connectors to facilitate a mechanical and an electrical connection between a corresponding one of the plurality of foil strips and a corresponding one of said plurality of buss bars. 13. The electrical junction box of claim 12, wherein said cover includes at least one latch member and said base includes at least one lock tab, said at least one latch member and said at least one lock tab being sized and shaped such that they are releasably engageable with one another. 14. The electrical junction box of claim 10, wherein one of said plurality of low insertion connectors is electrically connected to an external device, and another of said plurality of low insertion connectors is electrically connected to the external device.
