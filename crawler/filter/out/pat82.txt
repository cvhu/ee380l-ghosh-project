A system and method for installing a solar module on a roof using a mounting structure which can be adjusted after it has been fixed to the roof. The mounting structure is comprised of a plate having a slot into which an adjustable bracket is slidably positioned. The mounting structures are spaced from each other and the plates are fixed to the roof by toggle bolts or the like. A framed module is placed across the structures and one or both of the adjustable brackets are adjusted to align holes in the frame of the module with threaded chambers in the brackets. Next, threaded fasteners are passed through the holes and into the chambers to thereby secure the solar module to the roof.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar array comprising: at least two separate mounting structures each separate mounting structure comprising: a plate adapted to be secured to a support surface, said plate having a top side, a bottom side, and a slot therein; and a bracket positioned in said slot in said plate and able to slide within the slot, allowing adjustment of the bracket; at least one solar module, which comprises a frame; and means for securing said frame of said at least one solar module to said bracket; wherein a length and a width of said plate are each less than a width of said at least one solar module; and the said at least two separate mounting structures, when secured to a support surface, are spaced from each other at a distance approximately equal to one side of the at least one solar module whereby said at least one solar module spans said distance between said at least two separate mounting structures. 2. The solar array of claim 1 wherein said bracket comprises: a flange; and an upstanding portion affixed to said flange and extending upward through said slot, said upstanding portion having an internal threaded chamber formed therein. 3. The solar array of claim 2 wherein said frame of said at least one solar module having sides which encase said at least one solar module; each of two opposing sides of said frame of said at least one solar module having a hole therein which is aligned with said threaded chamber in a respective said bracket when said at least one solar module spans said distance between said at least two separate mounting structures; and threaded fasteners positioned through said respective hole in said frame and threaded into said respective threaded chamber to thereby secure said at least one solar module to said at least two separate mounting structures. 4. The solar array of claim 3 including: sealant substantially surrounding the perimeter of each of said at least two plates. 5. The solar array of claim 4 further comprising: a plurality of solar modules; and a plurality of mounting structures, at least two mounting structures of said plurality of mounting structures are spaced from each other to secure each solar module of said plurality of solar modules to said support surface. 6. The solar array of claim 5 wherein said support surface is a roof of a building, and adjacent modules of said plurality of solar modules overlap when installed. 7. A method of installing an array of solar modules, said method comprising: providing at least two separate mounting structures, wherein the said at least two separate mounting structures comprise: a plate adapted to be secured to a support surface, said plate having a top side, a bottom side, and a slot therein; and a bracket positioned in said slot in said plate and able to slide within the slot, allowing adjustment of the bracket, said bracket having means for receiving a fastener for securing a solar module to said at least two separate mounting structures; the said plate having a length and width, each of a dimension less than a width of said solar module; the said solar module having a frame; securing said at least two separate mounting structures on a support surface and spaced from each other at a distance equal to approximately a length of one side of the said solar module; positioning the said solar module across said at least two separate mounting structures; adjusting said bracket in one or both of said at least two separate mounting structures after said at least two separate mounting structures are secured to said support surface, thereby aligning holes in opposing sides of said solar module to said bracket of said at least two separate mounting structures; and passing fasteners through said holes in said solar module and into said respective mounting means of said brackets to thereby secure said solar module to said support surface. 8. The method of claim 7 wherein said holes in said solar module are formed in the sides of said frame that encases said solar module. 9. The method of claim 8 wherein said bracket comprises: a flange; and an upstanding portion affixed to said flange and extending upward through said slot; wherein said means for receiving said fasteners comprises a threaded chamber formed internally within said upstanding portion of said bracket. 10. The method of claim 9 wherein said plate of said at least two separate mounting structures is secured to said support surface by toggle bolts. 11. The method of claim 10 including: sealing said plates of said mounting structures to the support surface. 12. The method of claim 10 wherein said support surface is a roof of a building, and adjacent modules overlap when installed.
