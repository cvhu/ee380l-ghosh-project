An integrated module fame and racking system for a solar panel is disclosed. The solar panel comprises a plurality of solar modules and a plurality of splices for coupling the plurality of solar modules together. The plurality of splices provide a way to make the connected modules mechanically rigid both during transport to the roof and after mounting for the lifetime of the system, provide wiring connections between modules, provide an electrical grounding path for the modules, provide a way to add modules to the panel, and provide a way to remove or change a defective module. Connector sockets are provided on the sides of the modules to simplify the electrical assembly of modules when the modules are connected together with splices.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A splice for coupling two solar modules, the splice comprising: a conductive rigid body with four solid surfaces tapered from a middle portion to a distal portion for coupling two solar modules together, wherein the body has a feature on the body that is tapered from the middle portion of the splice to the distal portion of the splice that electrically connects the solar modules and is a grounding path between the solar modules; a coupling mechanism on the body that rigidly couples the two solar modules to each other; and a secure mechanism that secures the body to at least one of the two solar modules. 2. The splice of claim 1 wherein the feature on the body further comprises a raised feature on the outside of the body that provides a grounding path between the two solar modules. 3. The splice of claim 1 wherein the coupling mechanism comprises raised features on the body. 4. The splice of claim 1 wherein the secure mechanism comprises one or more screws. 5. The splice of claim 1 wherein the secure mechanism comprises a through pin. 6. The splice of claim 1 where the secure mechanism has a small amount of side-to-side sliding ability after being secured to account for thermal expansion and contraction.
