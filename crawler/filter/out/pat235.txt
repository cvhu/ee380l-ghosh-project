A cam-actuated connection device joins rail mounting members of a photovoltaic panel array. The connection device slides within channels of mounting members until the members are in a properly positioned grid. When in position, the connection device is rotated to lock the mounting members in a rigid grid network. The connecting device can be subsequently loosened, repositioned and locked into position. The rail-mounting members create a grid for installation of multiple PV panels. The mounting rail allows the unit to remain relatively compact in nature but still covers a wide range of PV panel thicknesses. The rail system has a hinged connection with the mounting rail that allows an installer to assemble the module in a near perpendicular fashion to the mounting rail, make the required electrical connections and then lower the PV module into its working position. The unit is then locked into its working position.Claims The invention claimed is: 1. Solar panel array mounting system, which comprises: (a) a series of base rails mountable to a surface in parallel relationship, each base rail having an upper slot; (b) a series of hinge rails disposable in parallel relationship perpendicularly to and above said series of base rails, each hinge rail having a lower slot and having upper retaining slots adapted to receive and retain tabs extending from solar panels; and (c) a cam-a-lock having a central I-bar having an upper head adapted to be retained within said hinge rail lower slot and a lower head adapted to be retained within said base rail upper slot, said central I-bar disposed within an inner sleeve having a threaded outer surface and disposed within an outer sleeve having an inner threaded surface in threading engagement with said inner sleeve outer threaded surface, whereby rotating said inner sleeve and outer sleeve with respect to each other tightens or looses said base rails to said hinge rails; whereby solar panels can be installed to said hinge rails by insertion of their tabs into said hinge rail upper slots.
