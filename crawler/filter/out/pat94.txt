The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising an inverter disposed in the interior space. 3. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a first systems charge gauge connected to one of the enclosure sides, wherein the first systems charge gauge monitors charging current from at least one photovoltaic. 4. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 3, further comprising a second systems charge gauge for monitoring the charge status of at least one of the plurality of batteries in the enclosure. 5. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a gasket disposed between the door and the projecting flange for providing a watertight connection. 6. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, wherein the predefined period of time can be adjusted after accessing the interior space. 7. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a high security containment area formed between the solar array frame, the trailer frame, the enclosure, the first support and the second support. 8. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 7, wherein the high security containment area comprises bars. 9. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 7, wherein the high security containment area comprises a steel grating with a hinged locking door. 10. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 9, wherein the hinged locking door has a bumper. 11. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, wherein the trailer has brakes. 12. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, wherein the enclosure has a protective cover removably disposed over the plurality of power interfaces. 13. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1 further comprising a shelf for supporting at least one rechargeable user device when plugged into one of the plurality of power interfaces. 14. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising at least one light disposed over the plurality of power interfaces, wherein the at least one light is connected to a light timer for controlling illumination over the plurality of power interfaces for a preset period of time, and further wherein the light timer communicates with the solar controller for providing power for illumination from at least one of the batteries, the at least one photovoltaic or combinations thereof. 15. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a first spring supporting the first wheel on the axel and a second spring supporting the second wheel on the axel. 16. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a first trailer brake light and a second trailer brake light. 17. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprising a storage box mounted to the trailer frame. 18. The portable solar power supply trailer of claim 1, further comprises at least one fender mounted over each wheel and secured to the trailer frame. 19.
