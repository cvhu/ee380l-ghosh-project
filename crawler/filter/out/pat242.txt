A photovoltaic panel clamp includes an upper and lower section. The interface between the assembled clamp halves and the module edge is filled by a flexible gasket material, such as EPDM rubber. The gasket preferably has small, finger like protrusions that allow for easy insertion onto the module edge while being reversed makes it more difficult to remove them from the module once installed. The clamp includes mounting posts or an integral axle to engage a bracket. The clamp also may include a locking tongue to secure the clamp to a bracket.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic panel clamp comprising: a clamp housing having an upper clamp face and lower clamp face; a mounting axle configured to provide an axis of rotation external to an edge of a photovoltaic panel and to interface to a photovoltaic panel mounting bracket; and a grommet formed between the upper and lower clamp faces; wherein the upper and lower clamp faces attach to an edge of a photovoltaic panel without penetrating the panel and hold the grommet against the panel, and the mounting axle provides an axis of rotation external to the edge of the panel, such that the panel can be lowered into a mounting bracket and rotated into an fixed position. 2. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, wherein the clamp housing is molded as a single piece. 3. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 2, wherein the mounting axle is formed as a separate component from the housing, and comprises a head and collar on each end to engage the bracket. 4. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 2, wherein the mounting axle comprises two mounting posts, one post formed on a first side the clamp, and a second post formed on a second side of the clamp. 5. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 4, wherein each mounting post comprises a head and a collar. 6. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 2, wherein the clamp housing further comprises two slots formed in the housing opposite the clamp faces, and the mounting axle is positioned internal to the clamp housing, perpendicular to and intersecting the two slots. 7. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, wherein the clamp housing comprises: an upper clamp section; and a lower clamp section. 8. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 7, wherein the mounting axle is formed as a separate component from the housing, and comprises a head and collar on each end to engage the bracket, and the mounting axle is positioned between the upper and lower clamp sections opposite the clamp faces. 9. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 7, wherein the clamp housing further comprises two slots formed in the upper and lower clamp sections, opposite the clamp faces, and the mounting axle is positioned internal to the clamp housing, perpendicular to and intersecting the two slots. 10. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 7, wherein the upper and lower sections are fastened with a threaded bolt. 11. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 7, wherein the upper and lower sections are snap fit together. 12. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 7, wherein the lower section comprises at least one locking tongue. 13. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, wherein the grommet comprises Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), formed with small finger-like protrusions to grip a solar panel. 14. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, wherein the axle comprises a flattened edge. 15. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, wherein the grommet comprises a filler block to engage panels having an offset lower edge. 16. The photovoltaic panel clamp of claim 1, further comprising at least one locking tongue on a bottom of the clamp housing. 17. A photovoltaic panel clamp comprising: an upper clamp section comprising: an upper clamp face; lower clamp section comprising: lower clamp face; a mounting axle comprising a metal rod having a head and collar on each end, wherein a collar has a smaller circumference than a head, and wherein the mounting axle is configured to provide an axis of rotation external to an edge of a photovoltaic panel and to interface to a photovoltaic panel mounting bracket; and a grommet formed between the upper clamp face and the lower clamp face; wherein the mounting axle is positioned between the clamp sections opposite the clamp faces, and wherein the upper and lower clamp faces attach to an edge of a photovoltaic panel without penetrating the panel. 18. The panel clamp of claim 17, wherein the grommet comprises a flexible gasket material. 19. The panel clamp of claim 18, wherein the grommet comprises Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), formed with small protrusions to grip a solar panel. 20. The panel clamp of claim 17, further comprising at least one locking tongue on the lower clamp section. 21. The panel clamp of claim 17, wherein the grommet comprises a filler block to engage panels having an offset lower edge.
