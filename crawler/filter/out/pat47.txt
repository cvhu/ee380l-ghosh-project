A method and apparatus for mounting solar panels is provided. Preferably, the apparatus includes a base, a solar panel receiving structure, and a support structure coupling the base to the solar panel receiving structure such that the solar panel receiving structure is at least one of elevated and angled relative to the base. The solar panel receiving structure preferably includes a base member, a first side member coupled to the base member, and a second side member coupled to the base member. Preferably, the first side member and the second side member are slotted so as to slidably receive at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base member.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar panel mounting structure, comprising: a base having a sufficient weight to withstand wind speeds at a surface of a roof without significant movement and be retained on the surface of the roof without fixing the base to the surface of the roof; a plurality of solar panels; a solar panel receiving structure for the plurality of solar panels, comprised of a base member, the solar panel receiving structure being elevated relative to the base to provide access under the solar panel; a first side member coupled to the base member; and a second side member coupled to the base member, the first and second side members being slotted to receive at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base, at least one of the first and second side members being adjustable in length to provide for an adjustably in elevation; and a support structure coupling the base to the solar panel receiving structure such that the solar panel receiving structure is at least one of elevated and angled relative to the base without attached to the surface of the roof, wherein the slotting of the first side member and the second side member provides for slidably receiving at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base member and provides greater retention of solar panels; one or more substantially diagonal members that interconnect opposite corners of the base. 2. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the base member has an adjustable length. 3. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the solar panel receiving structure further includes: a dividing member coupled to the base member between the first and second side members and oriented substantially parallel to the first and second side members wherein the dividing member is slotted so as to slidably receive a first solar panel between the first side member and the dividing member, and a second solar panel between the second side member and the dividing member. 4. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the solar panel receiving structure further includes: a dividing member coupled to the first and second side members and oriented substantially parallel to the base member, wherein the solar panel receiving structure slidably receives a first solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, the base member, and the dividing member, and wherein the solar panel receiving structure slidably receives a second solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the dividing member on a side opposite to the base member. 5. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the solar panel receiving structure further includes a retainer coupled to the first side member and the second side member opposite the base member. 6. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein a length of a first end of the supporting structure is different than a length of a second end of the supporting structure such that a plane of the base is angled relative to a plane of the solar panel receiving structure. 7. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 6, wherein an angle between the plane of the base and the plane of the solar panel receiving structure is not greater than about 45.degree.. 8. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein a length of at least one of a first end of the supporting structure and a second end of the supporting structure is adjustable such that a plane of the solar panel receiving structure may be angled relative to a plane of the base. 9. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the supporting structure includes a plurality of beams fixed at one end to the base and fixed at another end to the solar panel receiving structure. 10. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the supporting structure has a length sufficient to elevate the solar panel receiving structure at least about five feet above the base. 11. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 1, wherein the base includes a plurality of blocks coupled to the support structure. 12. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 11, wherein the base further includes a plurality of beams interconnecting the plurality of blocks. 13. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 11, wherein the plurality of blocks are formed of a solid rubber. 14. The solar panel mounting structure of claim 11, wherein the plurality of blocks have sufficient weight to withstand a wind speed of about 90 mph.
