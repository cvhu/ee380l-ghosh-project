The subject matter of the invention is an inverter (3), more specifically for use in a photovoltaic plant (1) with a direct voltage input (connection terminals 4; 5) for connection to a generator (2) and an alternating voltage output (connection terminals 7; 8) for feeding into an energy supply network (6) as well as with a DC-AC converter (12) with semiconductor switch elements (15) and an intermediate circuit (11), at least one short-circuit switch element (18) being connected in parallel to the generator (2), so that the voltage will not exceed a maximum voltage value neither at the connection terminals (4; 5) of the generator (2) nor between the connection terminals (9; 10) of the inverter. This is achieved in that the inverter (3) comprises, in the intermediate circuit (12), a buffer capacitor (14) that is connected to the generator (2) through a protection diode (17) so that said buffer capacitor (14) will not be discharged upon actuation of the short-circuit switch element (18), the generator (2) working according to a clock rate in the short-circuit mode of operation.Claims We claim: 1. A method of operating an inverter connected to a photovoltaic generator through a boost converter with a short-circuit switch element, the method comprising: monitoring a voltage associated with an intermediate circuit within the inverter; switching the generator into a short-circuit mode by closing and maintaining closed, subject to a current-limit mode condition, the short-circuit switch element when the monitored voltage exceeds a threshold voltage; and switching the generator out of the short-circuit mode by opening the short-circuit switch element after the monitored voltage has dropped below the threshold voltage, wherein switching the generator into the short-circuit mode subject to the current-limit mode condition comprises monitoring a current in the short-circuit switch element and opening the switch if the current exceeds a predetermined limit, and subsequently closing the short-circuit switch element again. 2. An inverter, comprising: a DC input terminal configured to couple to a source of DC energy; an intermediate circuit configured to provide a temporary storage of DC energy provided by a DC voltage at the DC input terminal; a voltage limiting circuit coupled to the DC input terminal, and configured to generate and maintain a short-circuit condition, subject to a current-limit mode condition, at the DC input terminal when a monitored voltage associated with a DC voltage within the intermediate circuit exceeds a predetermined threshold; and a DC/AC converter configured to convert a DC voltage provided at the DC input terminal into an AC voltage, and provide the AC voltage to an output terminal, wherein the voltage limiting circuit is further configured to monitor a current therein when the short-circuit condition is generated, and temporarily suspend the short-circuit condition if the current exceeds a predetermined value.
