The solar system as claimed in claim 3, wherein for each communication master at least one standby communication master is provided, which operates in normal operation as communication slave and in the event of an error assumes the function of the communication master. 5. The solar system as claimed in claim 2, wherein for each communication master at least one standby communication master is provided, which operates in normal operation as communication slave and in the event of an error assumes the function of the communication master. 6. The solar system as claimed in claim 2, wherein for each communication master at least one standby communication master is provided, which operates in normal operation as communication slave and in the event of an error assumes the function of the communication master. 7. The solar system as claimed in claim 2, wherein for each communication master at least one standby communication master is provided, which operates in normal operation as communication slave and in the event of an error assumes the function of the communication master. 8. The solar system as claimed in claim 1, wherein a router is switched between a the communication network and the communication master. 9. The solar system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the solar inverters of the first part and the solar inverters of the further part are identical in construction. 10. The solar system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the solar inverters of the first part and the solar inverters of the further part are identical in construction. 11.
