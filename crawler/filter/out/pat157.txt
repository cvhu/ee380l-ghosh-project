A photovoltaic inverter with an inverter housing includes at least a first chamber and a second chamber separated by a wall. The first chamber has a higher Ingress Protection (IP) rating than the second chamber. The first chamber accommodates at least one electronic component part of the photovoltaic inverter. A surface of the wall facing the second chamber provides a plurality of fuse housings. Each of the fuse housings accommodates a fuse and being coupled to a plug connector electrically connected to the fuse. The plug connectors provide electrical connections to the first chamber.Claims We claim: 1. A photovoltaic inverter with an inverter housing comprising: at least a first chamber and a second chamber separated by a wall, the first chamber having a higher Ingress Protection (IP) rating than the second chamber, the first chamber accommodating at least one electronic component part of the photovoltaic inverter, a surface of the wall facing the second chamber provides a plurality of fuse housings, each of the fuse housings accommodating a fuse and being coupled to a plug connector electrically connected to the fuse, the plug connectors providing electrical connections to the first chamber. 2. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 1, wherein each plug connector is configured to be pushed into the respective fuse housing. 3. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 1, wherein each fuse housing is accommodated by a fuse receptacle disposed in the wall, each fuse receptacle providing an electrical connection to the at lease one electronic component part. 4. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 3, wherein the at least one electronic component part is a circuit board. 5. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 3, wherein each fuse receptacle includes a cylindrical appended portion configured to couple to the respective fuse housing. 6. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 1, wherein each fuse housing is integrally connected with the respective plug connector, each plug connector and fuse housing being removably fastened to at least one of the respective fuse receptacle and a respective appended portion on the wall. 7. The photovoltaic inverter of claim 6, wherein, each plug connector and fuse housing is screwed or clamped to at least one of the respective fuse receptacle and the respective appended portion. 8. The photovoltaic inverter as set forth in claim 1, wherein the plurality of fuse housings form a housing block, the housing block accommodating the plurality of plug connectors.
