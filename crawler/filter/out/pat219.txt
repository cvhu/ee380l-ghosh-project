A system includes a solar power subsystem that receives power from one or more solar power arrays. A storage control subsystem is coupled to the solar power subsystem to charge a battery from the power received by the solar power subsystem. A grid power control subsystem having an AC to DC converter receives power from a power grid and provides DC voltage to the storage control subsystem. A balance of system control system controls the amount of power received from the power grid as a function of a load, battery charge and received power by the solar power subsystem. The solar array and battery may be sized to provide sufficient power under normal operating conditions, with power being drawn from the grid during abnormal operation conditions.Claims The invention claimed is: 1.

The system of claim 12 and further comprising: a battery controller to monitor a battery drain rate; wherein the balance of system control system determines expected power to be received from the solar array, determines if the battery has sufficient power to power the loads prior to the solar array providing power to sufficiently power the loads and recharge the battery, and controls the grid power control subsystem to draw power from the grid if sufficient power from the solar array is not expected. 19. The system of claim 12 and further comprising: an application control subsystem to monitor power needed by the load, and to reduce power provided to selected loads as a function of power received from the solar array and available battery power. 20. The system of claim 19 wherein the application control subsystem turns off selected loads when insufficient power from the battery and solar array is available. 21. The system of claim 19 wherein power is reduced to selected loads as a function of a predetermined priority for each load. 22.
