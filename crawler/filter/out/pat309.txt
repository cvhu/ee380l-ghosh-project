A photovoltaic system includes an inverter, a photovoltaic generator with a plurality of serially connected photovoltaic modules, said photovoltaic generator connected to the inverter by an electrical supply line, a controllable fuse interconnected in the electrical supply line between the inverter and the photovoltaic generator and having a signal input, and a voltage-dependent resistor connected between the signal input of the controllable fuse and the electrical supply line and generating a control signal which triggers the controllable fuse responsive to the control signal and interrupts the electrical supply line. The controllable fuse can be used to disconnect the electrical connection of the photovoltaic system to the inverter when a switch short-circuiting one or more modules of the photovoltaic generator malfunctions. The arrangement permits operation of photovoltaic system at an operating voltage of close to 1000 V, thereby allowing use of thinner cables.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic system comprising: an inverter, a photovoltaic generator comprising a plurality of serially connected photovoltaic modules, said photovoltaic generator connected to the inverter by an electrical supply line, a controllable fuse interconnected in the electrical supply line between the inverter and the photovoltaic generator and having a signal input, and a voltage-dependent resistor connected between the signal input of the controllable fuse and the electrical supply line and generating a control signal which triggers the controllable fuse responsive to the control signal and interrupts the electrical supply line. 2. The photovoltaic system of claim 1, wherein the controllable fuse is a self-destructing fuse. 3. The photovoltaic system of claim 2, wherein the controllable fuse is a pyroelectric fuse. 4. The photovoltaic system of claim 1, wherein the controllable fuse is an overvoltage protector. 5. The photovoltaic system of claim 4, further comprising a control unit, wherein the overvoltage protector has a signal output which provides a second signal when the overvoltage protector is triggered, which second signal is supplied to the control unit which generates from the second signal the control signal. 6. The photovoltaic system of claim 4, wherein the overvoltage protector is constructed based on zinc oxide. 7. The photovoltaic system of claim 5, wherein the control signal is a DC voltage signal providing a DC current between 2 A and 5 A for a duration of at least 10 ms.
