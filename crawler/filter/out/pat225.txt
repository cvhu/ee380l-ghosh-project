A method and apparatus for mounting solar panels is provided. Preferably, the apparatus includes a base, a solar panel receiving structure, and a support structure coupling the base to the solar panel receiving structure such that the solar panel receiving structure is at least one of elevated and angled relative to the base. The solar panel receiving structure preferably includes a base member, a first side member coupled to the base member, and a second side member coupled to the base member. Preferably, the first side member and the second side member are slotted so as to slidably receive at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base member.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A rooftop solar panel mounting structure comprising: a base having a sufficient weight to retain the base on a surface of the rooftop without fixing the base to the surface of the rooftop; a solar panel receiving structure mounted to the base and adapted to slidingly receive and retain a plurality of solar panels; and means for adjustably elevating and angling the solar panel receiving structure above the base; wherein the solar panel receiving structure comprises slotted members adapted to receive the plurality of solar panels. 2. The rooftop solar panel receiving structure as recited in claim 1, wherein the plurality of solar panels comprises a plurality of substantially flat solar panels, and wherein adapted to slidingly receive the plurality of solar panels comprises adapted to adjustably receive the plurality of solar panels into the solar panel receiving structure. 3. The rooftop solar panel receiving structure as recited in claim 1, wherein the plurality of solar panels comprises a plurality of substantially flat solar panel arrays. 4. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 1, wherein the mounting structure comprises a photovoltaic solar panel mounting structure. 5. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 1, wherein the base having the sufficient weight to retain the base on a surface of the rooftop comprises a plurality of solid blocks. 6. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 5.sub.5, wherein the plurality of solid blocks are interconnected to provide enhanced structural integrity to the base. 7. A rooftop solar panel mounting structure comprising: a base having a sufficient weight to retain the base on a surface of the rooftop without fixing the base to the surface of the rooftop; a solar panel receiving structure mounted to the base and adapted to slidingly receive and retain a plurality of solar panels; and means for adjustably elevating and angling the solar panel receiving in structure above the base; wherein the base having the sufficient weight to retain the base on a surface of the rooftop comprises a plurality of solid blocks. 8. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 7, wherein the plurality of solid blocks are interconnected to provide enhanced structural integrity to the base. 9. The rooftop solar panel receiving structure as recited in claim 7, wherein the plurality of solar panels comprises a plurality of substantially flat solar panels, and wherein adapted to slidingly receive the plurality of solar panels comprises adapted to adjustably receive the plurality of solar panels into the solar panel receiving structure. 10. The rooftop solar panel receiving structure as recited in claim 7, wherein the plurality of solar panels comprises a plurality of substantially flat solar panel arrays. 11. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 7, wherein the mounting structure comprises a photovoltaic solar panel mounting structure. 12. The rooftop solar panel mounting structure as recited in claim 7, wherein the solar panel receiving structure comprises slotted members adapted to receive the plurality of solar panels.
