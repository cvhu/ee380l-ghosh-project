A solar tracker has a mounting surface to which a solar device is mounted and means for causing the mounting surface to change its orientation so as to be substantially perpendicular to the sun's rays as the sun travels through a useful arc relative to the solar tracker wherein change of orientation of the mounting surface is caused by bending of the solar tracker attributable. The bending can be caused by mechanical contraction or due to shrinkage caused by loss of water in which case capillary action causes the outer surface material to be saturated and grow when it is not exposed to sunlight. The bendable mounting surface support is an elongated tube held in a nominally vertical position in the absence of sunlight by a vertical support which can be a coiled compression spring, an extruded tube of closed-end structural foam, a vertical floating pole or an air-inflated tube.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar tracker, comprising: a mounting surface to which a solar device is mounted; a bendable mounting surface support with an outer surface material that expands when exposed to water but not exposed to sunlight and contracts when exposed to sunlight that supports the mounting surface; and a device for collecting electrical energy from the solar device; wherein the outer surface material expands and grows due to absorption of water when it is without sunlight and sunlight shining on the outer surface material causes a sunlit side of the outer surface material to shrink relative to a shaded side of the outer surface material not exposed to sunlight due to drying of the sunlit side thus causing the bendable mounting surface support to bend toward the direction of sunlight so that the mounting surface is substantially perpendicular to said direction of sunlight as the sun travels through a useful arc relative to the solar tracker. 2. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the solar tracker is mounted to a platform. 3. The solar tracker of claim 2, wherein the platform sits atop a water source and the water is in constant contact with the outer surface material so that capillary action causes the outer surface material to be saturated when it is not exposed to sunlight. 4. The solar tracker of claim 3, wherein the platform floats atop the water source. 5. The solar tracker of claim 2, further comprising: a water reservoir in constant contact with the outer surface material so that the capillary action causes the outer surface material to be saturated when it is not exposed to sunlight. 6. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the solar device does not extend beyond the mounting surface relative to the bendable mounting surface support. 7. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the solar device is comprised of a photovoltaic cell and a Fresnel lens held in a fixed position relative to the photovoltaic cell for concentrating sunlight on the photovoltaic cell. 8. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the solar device is comprised of a Stirling cycle engine. 9. The solar tracker of claim 8, wherein the solar device is further comprised of a concentrator for concentrating sunlight to the Stirling cycle engine and an electrical generator connected to the Stirling cycle engine. 10. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the bendable mounting surface support is an elongated tube. 11. The solar tracker of claim 10, wherein the elongated tube is held in a nominally vertical position in the absence of sunlight by a vertical support. 12. The solar tracker of claim 11, wherein the vertical support is comprised of a coiled compression spring. 13. The solar tracker of claim 11, wherein the vertical support is comprised of an extruded tube of closed-cell structural foam. 14. The solar tracker of claim 11, wherein the vertical support is comprised of a nominally vertical floating pole. 15. The solar tracker of claim 11, wherein the vertical support is comprised of an air-inflated tube. 16. The solar tracker of claim 15, wherein the air-inflated tube is maintained inflated by use of electricity generated by the solar device. 17. The solar tracker of claim 1, wherein the device for collecting electrical energy is an electrical wire.
