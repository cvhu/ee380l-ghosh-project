A system and method for identifying the solar potential of rooftops. In one embodiment, solar-potential criteria and three-dimensional spatial data and tabular data, for a selected area including parcels on which the rooftops are located, are entered into a geographic information system. Three-dimensional aerial data of the selected area, including the rooftops in the selected area, is collected. Solar azimuth and altitude angles are calculated for regular intervals to generate shadow simulation data representing shadows cast onto the rooftops by obstructions. The shadow simulation data is intersected with the XYZ coordinates of the rooftop shapes, as determined from the aerial data, to generate rooftop shade patterns for specific intervals over a specific period of time. The tabular data and the rooftop shade patterns are then used to determine addresses and per-parcel specifications of buildings having said rooftops meeting the solar-potential criteria.Claims What is claimed is: 1.
