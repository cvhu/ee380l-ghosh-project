A photovoltaic array including a plurality of photovoltaic assemblies and a plurality of mounting units. The mounting units each include an elongate rail and a plurality of leg assemblies. The rail is sized and configured to maintain a portion of at least two of the photovoltaic assemblies, with the leg assemblies extending from the rail in a spaced-apart fashion and terminating in a foot for placement against a rooftop structure for minimally penetration installation. Further, at least one of the leg assemblies can include a retractable leg. When the photovoltaic array is installed to a rooftop structure including a membrane intermittently secured to a rooftop deck, the retractable leg accommodates upward billowing of the membrane under windy conditions.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic array comprising: a plurality of photovoltaic assemblies each including a photovoltaic laminate; and a plurality of mounting units supporting the photovoltaic assemblies relative to a rooftop structure, each of the mounting units including: an elongate rail configured to maintain a portion of at least two of the photovoltaic assemblies, a plurality of leg assemblies extending from the rail in a spaced-apart fashion and each terminating in a foot opposite the rail, at least one of the leg assemblies includes a retractable leg and a corresponding foot, wherein the retractable supporting leg assembly supports the photovoltaic array relative to downward forces, yet at least partially retracts in response to forces applied to the corresponding foot when in the installed position. 2. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic array is configured for mounting to a commercial building rooftop structure including a membrane overlying a rooftop deck, the membrane being intermittently connected to the rooftop deck such that an unconnected region of the membrane can billow upwardly from the rooftop deck in response to wind, and further wherein the retractable leg is configured to accommodate billowing of the unconnected region upon final installation of the photovoltaic array to the rooftop structure. 3. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein at least two of the leg assemblies include a rigid leg. 4. The photovoltaic array of claim 3, wherein the retractable leg is located between the rigid legs along a length of the rail. 5. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein the retractable leg includes a spring. 6. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein a plurality of the leg assemblies include a retractable leg. 7. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein a length of each of the legs in extension from the rail, including the retractable leg in an undeflected state, is identical. 8. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein each of the mounting units further includes: a plurality of fasteners for coupling selective ones of the feet to the rooftop structure in a penetrating fashion; wherein upon final installation, the foot associated with at least the retractable leg is not coupled to the rooftop structure by a penetrating fastener. 9. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein the rail is lightweight, having a size and weight selected to satisfy a maximum moment constraint determined as the greater of an installation environment uplift load calculation and an installation environment downward load calculation. 10. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein the rail includes: a first rail segment maintaining one of the leg assemblies otherwise having a rigid leg; and a second rail segment maintaining the leg assembly having the retractable leg; wherein the first and second rail segments are configured to be selectively assembled to one another. 11. The photovoltaic array of claim 10, wherein the first and second rail segments are configured to be slidably assembled to one another. 12. The photovoltaic array of claim 1, wherein the photovoltaic array includes the mounting unit maintaining a spacing between immediately adjacent photovoltaic assemblies mounted thereto.
