A modular shade system comprises a support structure supporting modular panels. The support structure defines a first area having a length and a width. The modular panels have upper, exposed surfaces and lower surfaces and are mounted to and supported by the support structure. The modular panels cover at least about 80% of the first area. The modular panels comprise PV panels and supplemental panels, the supplemental panels providing a feature other than shading and optionally providing shading. Protective panels may be mounted opposite the lower surfaces of the PV modules. A protective panel may so be used when the PV module is part of an installation other than a modular shade structure.Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A modular shade system comprising: a support structure, supportable by a support surface, defining an elevated, generally horizontal first area having a length and a width, the first area having a periphery; a planar array of modular panels, having upper and lower surfaces, mounted to and supported by the support structure at the first area to form the shade system, the modular panels covering at least about 80% of the first area, the upper surfaces of the modular panels being exposed surfaces; the shade system being a wall-less shade system having open side regions extending downwardly from the periphery of the first area; the modular panels comprising PV panels acting as a source of electricity and supplemental panels; a separate protective panel for each of the PV panels, the protective panels mounted to the shading system opposite and covering substantially the entire lower surfaces of each of the PV panels, the protective panels comprising at least one of a wire mesh and a sheet of material, the modular shade system defining open regions below the protective panels; the protective panels being spaced apart from the lower surfaces of the PV panels to define open regions therebetween; and the supplemental panels being other than PV panels and optionally providing shading. 2. The system according to claim 1 wherein the support structure comprises: a series of generally parallel purlins supporting the modular panels; beams located beneath the purlins and oriented transversely to said purlins, the purlins secured to and supported by the beams; and a generally vertical column secured to and supporting each of said beams. 3. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise light-transmissive panels and wherein light-transmissive panels cover about 0 to 50% of the first area. 4. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise light-transmissive panels and wherein light-transmissive panels cover about 5 to 30% of the first area. 5. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise light-transmissive panels and wherein the light-transmissive panels are placed adjacent to one another along a path parallel to the length. 6. The system according to claim 1 wherein the PV panels comprise light-transmissive PV panels. 7. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise light-transmissive panels and wherein the PV panels and light-transmissive panels cover at least about 90% of the first area. 8. The system according to claim 1 wherein the protective panels comprise at least one of sheet metal, perforated sheet metal, plastic, perforated plastic, cement board, perforated cement board, and phosphorescent material. 9. The system according to claim 1 wherein at least some of the modular panels are constructed to permit some light to pass therethrough. 10. The system according to claim 1 wherein the protective panels have a lower protective panel surface, at least substantially the entire lower protective panel surface being convex. 11. The system according to claim 1 wherein the protective panels comprise ventilating perforations to provide ventilation for the PV panels. 12. The system according to claim 1 wherein the PV panels cover at least about 90% of the first area. 13. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise phosphorescent panels to provide passive nighttime illumination beneath the shade system. 14. The system according to claim 1 wherein the supplemental panels comprise planter panels for planting of plants. 15. A photovoltaic assembly comprising: a mounting structure supportable by a support surface; PV modules having upper and lower surfaces and supported by the mounting structure; a separate protective panel for each of the PV modules, the protective panels mounted to at least one of the mounting structure and the PV modules opposite and covering substantially the entire the lower surfaces of the PV modules, the protective panels comprising at least one of a wire mesh and a sheet of material, the photovoltaic assembly defining open regions below the protective panels; and the protective panels being spaced apart from the lower surfaces of the PV panels to define open regions therebetween. 16. The system according to claim 15 wherein the protective panel comprises at least one of sheet metal, perforated sheet metal, plastic, perforated plastic, cement board, perforated cement board, and phosphorescent material. 17. The system according to claim 15 wherein the PV module and the protective panel are constructed to permit some light to pass therethrough. 18. The system according to claim 15 wherein the protective panel has a lower protective panel surface, at least substantially the entire lower protective panel surface being convex. 19. The system according to claim 15 wherein the protective panel comprises ventilating perforations to provide ventilation for the PV module.
