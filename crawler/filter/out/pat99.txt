Apparatuses and methods to reduce safety risks associated with photovoltaic systems by providing a safety switch on a photovoltaic panel. In one embodiment, a photovoltaic panel includes: at least one photovoltaic cell; a connector to output energy from the photovoltaic panel; and a switch coupled between the at least one photovoltaic cell and the connector. The switch is configured to disconnect the at least one photovoltaic cell from the connector during installation of the photovoltaic panel, and to connect the at least one photovoltaic cell with the connector after installation of the photovoltaic panel.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic panel, comprising: at least one photovoltaic cell disposed on the photovoltaic panel; a connector to output energy from the at least one photovoltaic cell of the photovoltaic panel; a junction box to host the connector of the photovoltaic panel; and a safety switch integrated with the junction box of the photovoltaic panel and coupled between the at least one photovoltaic cell and the connector, the safety switch comprising a relay and a second switch having a removable portion, the safety switch configured to disconnect the at least one photovoltaic cell from the connector when the removable portion is with the safety switch, the safety switch configured to connect the at least one photovoltaic cell with the connector when the removable portion is removed from the safety switch; wherein the removable portion of the safety switch is operable from outside of the junction box. 2. The photovoltaic panel of claim 1, wherein the safety switch comprises a wiring connector to control the relay. 3. The photovoltaic panel of claim 1, further comprising: a circuit to detect a load from an inverter, wherein the safety switch is to connect an output of the photovoltaic panel to the connector when the circuit detects a load from an inverter and to disconnect the output in absence of a load from an inverter. 4. The photovoltaic panel of claim 1, further comprising: a voltage module to adjust an output of the at least one photovoltaic cell; wherein the safety switch is coupled to the voltage module. 5. The photovoltaic panel of claim 4, wherein the voltage module outputs an alternating current (AC) output. 6. The photovoltaic panel of claim 4, further comprising connectors for wirings to control a state of the safety switch.
