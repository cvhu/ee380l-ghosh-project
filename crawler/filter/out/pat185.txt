A switching apparatus for grounding an inverter (3) that converts a direct current voltage into an alternative current voltage at mains frequency, with an inverter housing (7) and with a safety fuse (8) that connects a positive or a negative direct current voltage to a grounding terminal, is intended to be provided such that a technician has the possibility of grounding an inverter appliance optionally positively or negatively at little expense, with the possibility for an IP-65 region of the appliance to remain closed. This is achieved in that a safety fuse (8), which is accessible and can be plugged from the outside, is arranged on said inverter housing (7) and can be contacted optionally to a positive or a negative direct current voltage in such a manner that either a positive or a negative direct current voltage is grounded through said safety fuse (8).Claims I claim: 1.

The inverter of claim 3, wherein the monitoring circuit further comprises two shunts, wherein a first shunt of the two shunts lies on a positive current path of the inverter circuitry and a second shunt of the two shunts lies on a negative current path of the inverter circuitry. 5. The inverter of claim 3, wherein the monitoring circuit further comprises two switches configured to establish different measurement conditions for determining an isolation resistance, wherein a first switch of the two switches lies between the positive direct current voltage terminal and the ground terminal, and a second switch of the two switches lies between the negative direct current voltage terminal and the ground terminal. 6.

The inverter of claim 1, wherein the inverter circuitry further comprises a transformer configured to provide for galvanic separation. 8. The inverter of claim 3, wherein the monitoring circuit further comprises a selectively activatable alternating current voltage source coupled via a transformer to a current detection circuit operable to detect a current in the monitoring circuit in a condition when the safety fuse is coupled to the inverter circuitry and has not blown, thereby enabling a determination of a condition of the safety fuse without the inverter being coupled to the grid. 9. A safety fuse device in combination with an inverter circuit, comprising: a plug connector part comprising at least two plug terminals; a safety fuse housed within the plug connector part, and coupled between two of the at least two plug terminals, wherein the safety fuse is operable to provide a short circuit between the two of the at least two plug terminals in a first state, and provide an open circuit between the two of the at least two plug terminals in a second state, wherein the safety fuse is configured to interface with three plug terminals of the inverter circuit in two different orientations, wherein in a first orientation the safety fuse device couples together a positive direct current voltage terminal and a ground terminal of the inverter circuit, and in a second, different orientation couples together a negative direct current voltage terminal and the ground terminal of the inverter circuit, and wherein the plug connector part further comprises one of a mechanical plug coding or an electrical plug coding operable to provide an indication of the first or second orientation.
