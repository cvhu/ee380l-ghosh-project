A solar energy system (55) has aspects that can allow individualized control and analysis for overall field power control that can be used while harvesting maximum power from a solar energy source (1) and a string of solar panels (11) for a power grid (10). The invention provides control of power at high efficiency with aspects that can exist independently including: 1) power management with switch disconnect control (64), 2) sequenced start of a solar power system, 3) providing a safety output system that can be handled by installers and maintenance and advantageously controlled, 4) providing programmable power functionality controller (86) either on site or remotely from an administrative facility by radio transmission individual solar panel disconnect control (85), 5) a system with pattern analyzer (87) for operational, installation, and maintenance indications, and 6) systems with individual solar panel string power simulator (89) for disparate components.
