In one embodiment, a photovoltaic frame assembly comprises a photovoltaic module and a frame having a plurality of air vents. The air vents allow air to flow into the frame and thereby cool the photovoltaic module. The frame may be installed in-line with another such frame to allow air flow between frames. The air vents may be located within a perimeter of the frame to allow for structural integrity while remaining aesthetically pleasing. The frame may include an inner lip, an outer lip, or both to provide different mounting options to accommodate different sites. The frame may comprise a plurality of frame members, such as extrusions including the air vents.Claims What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for mounting a photovoltaic module frame on a roof, the apparatus comprising: a first set of frame members forming a frame of a first photovoltaic module, each frame member in the first set of frame members on all sides of the frame having a plurality of air vents within a perimeter of each frame member; and a mounting portion integrally formed with a frame member in the first set of frame members. 2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the mounting portion comprises: an outer lip facing an exterior of the frame of the first photovoltaic module, the outer lip having a provision for roof attachment; and an inner lip facing an interior of the frame of the first photovoltaic module, the inner lip having a provision for attachment to a structure that may be attached to a roof. 3. The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the outer lip is formed opposite to the inner lip. 4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the mounting portion comprises an extrusion with an outer lip facing an exterior of the frame of the first photovoltaic module, the outer lip having a provision for roof attachment. 5. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: a second set of frame members forming a frame of a second photovoltaic module, each frame member in the second set of frame members having a plurality of air vents within a perimeter of each frame member, wherein the frame of the second photovoltaic module is in-line with the frame of the first photovoltaic module such that air flows from under the first photovoltaic module to under the second photovoltaic module through air vents. 6. The apparatus of claim 5 further comprising: a mounting hardware attaching an outer lip of a frame member in the first set of frame members and an outer lip of a frame member in the second set of frame members to a roofing plane. 7. The apparatus of claim 6 wherein the mounting hardware comprises: a clip clamping an outer lip of a frame member in the first set of frame members and an outer lip of a frame member in the second set of frame members. 8. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each frame member in the first set of frame members further comprises a slot for accepting and supporting an edge of the first photovoltaic module. 9. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein the slot runs along a length of each frame member. 10. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each frame member in the first set of frame members comprises an extruded material. 11. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the photovoltaic module comprises an array of backside-contact photovoltaic cells. 12. A photovoltaic module assembly comprising: a photovoltaic module; a frame surrounding and supporting the photovoltaic module, the frame having a mounting portion configured to allow attachment of the frame to a roof and having a plurality of air vents within a perimeter of the frame on all sides of the frame. 13. The photovoltaic module assembly of claim 12 wherein the frame further comprises: an outer lip facing outward of the frame, the outer lip being configured to allow attachment of the frame to the roof and to allow attachment of the frame to another frame. 14. The photovoltaic module assembly of claim 12 wherein the frame further comprises: an inner lip facing an interior of the frame, the inner lip being configured to allow attachment of the frame to a substructure that may be attached to the roof. 15. The photovoltaic module assembly of claim 12 wherein the frame comprises: a plurality of extrusions including the air vents. 16. The photovoltaic module assembly of claim 12 wherein the frame is attached to a substructure that is attached to the roof. 17. The photovoltaic module assembly of claim 12 wherein the photovoltaic module comprises an array of backside-contact photovoltaic cells. 18. A method of installing photovoltaic modules on a roof, the method comprising: installing a first photovoltaic module and a second photovoltaic module on a roof such that air flows through frame members of the first photovoltaic module and into frame members of the second photovoltaic module, the first and second photovoltaic modules including a plurality of air vents on all sides of their respective frames. 19. The method of claim 18 wherein installing the first and second photovoltaic modules comprises: clamping an outer lip of a frame member framing the first photovoltaic module together with an outer lip of a frame member framing the second photovoltaic module. 20. The method of claim 18 wherein each frame member framing the first and second photovoltaic modules comprises extruded aluminum.
