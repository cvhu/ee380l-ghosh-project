A control strategy for distributed power generation modules in a power system that varies the line frequency or voltage according to a predetermined pattern to cause a PV inverter to modify its power output and thereby avoid overcharging a battery. When the power system operates in islanded mode, the AC load demand can be lower than the available energy from the PV array, causing the battery to become overcharged. To avoid this scenario, a hybrid inverter executes a pattern generator algorithm that varies the line frequency or voltage linearly, exponentially or any mathematical function or look-up tables. The PV inverter executes a pattern detection algorithm that detects the linear, exponential, or any mathematical function or look-up table change in the line frequency. In response, the PV inverter modifies its power output until an overcharging condition of the battery is removed. The line frequency/voltage can be varied within the anti-islanding limits.Claims What is claimed is: 1.
