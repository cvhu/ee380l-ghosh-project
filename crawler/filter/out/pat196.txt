The connector assembly in accordance with claim 5, wherein the aperture is sized and shaped to receive a cable seal that surrounds the conductive cable, the cable seal being compressed against the outer surface to protect the inner region of the connector housing from an ambient environment. 8. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 7, wherein the connector housing includes a housing cap that holds the cable seal within the aperture. 9. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 1, wherein the slot includes first and second slot portions that extend radially away from the cable channel in substantially opposite directions. 10. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 1, wherein the conductive cable is a pair of conductive cables and the retaining member is a pair of retaining members. 11. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 1, wherein the connector housing includes a mounting surface that extends between the loading and mating sides, the cable channel opening to the mounting surface. 12. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 11, further comprising a cover coupled to the mounting surface, the cover holding the conductive cable and the retaining member within the cable channel and the slot, respectively. 13. An electrical connector assembly configured to be coupled to a photovoltaic (PV) module, the connector assembly comprising: a plurality of housing sides including opposite loading and mating sides and a mounting surface extending therebetween; a cable channel extending between the loading and mating sides along the mounting surface, the cable channel being sized and shaped to receive a conductive cable so that the conductive cable extends along a cable axis when located within the cable channel; and a slot sized and shaped to have a retaining member inserted therein, the slot oriented substantially transverse to the cable channel so that the retaining member extends substantially transverse to the cable axis, the slot opening to the mounting surface so that the retaining member is insertable into the slot in a mounting direction that is orthogonal to the cable axis. 14. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 13 further comprising a cover that is configured to be mounted to the mounting surface and hold the conductive cable and the retaining member within the cable channel and the slot, respectively, when mounted to the mounting surface. 15. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 13 further comprising an aperture that provides access to the cable channel through the loading side, the conductive cable being insertable into the cable channel through the aperture. 16. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 13 further comprising a main body formed from a single piece of insulative material that is shaped to include the housing sides, the cable channel, and the slot. 17. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 13 further comprising a housing cap configured to engage the conductive cable. 18. The connector assembly in accordance with claim 13, wherein the slot includes first and second slot portions that extend radially away from the cable channel in substantially opposite directions. 19.
