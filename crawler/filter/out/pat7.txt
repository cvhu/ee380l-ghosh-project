An inexpensive energy monitoring device and method for measuring energy usage and power costs in real time. The invention can include an external type digital battery powered camera that can be mounted away from and adjacent to the outdoor utility meter on a rotatable arm, which can send data signals to remote locations indoors using wireless such as an RF signal to a detector/display inside the residence. The indoor unit can be programmed to display desirable energy status information to a home owner on power usage and power costs on a daily bases, monthly bases, and yearly bases so that the home owner can budget energy usage and energy costs as needed. A shield can also be used with device and method for shielding power meters from adverse weather conditions.Claims We claim: 1. A method of monitoring energy usage in real-time, comprising the steps of: mounting a meter reader sensor spaced apart from a utility meter; detecting speed of a rotating utility meter disk in the meter with the sensor; remotely transmitting in open air the speed of the rotating disk; and displaying energy usage on a display that receives the open air speed transmission. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting speed step includes the step of: sensing up to approximately 100 frame pictures per second of the rotating meter disk. 3. The method of claim 2, wherein the step of sensing includes the step of: sensing up to approximately 2300 frame pictures per second. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the mounting step includes the step of: mounting a rotatable arm to a wall adjacent to the utility meter, the arm having a perpendicular position with the sensor attached to an end of the arm, and the sensor being adjacent to and above the meter, and the arm being rotatable to an extended position with the arm rotated outward to extend away from the meter. 5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: sliding the sensor in a horizontal direction relative to the arm; and rotating the sensor relative to the end of the arm. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein the remotely transmitting step includes the step of: powering the transmitter with solar power. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the remotely transmitting step includes the step of: powering the transmitter with a battery. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the displaying step includes the step of: displaying monthly energy usage to date. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the displaying step includes the step of: displaying last 24 hour energy usage. 10. The method of claim 1, wherein the displaying step includes the step of: displaying monthly energy billing cost usage to date. 11. The method of claim 1, wherein the displaying step includes the step of: displaying last 24 hour billing cost usage. 12. The method of claim 1, wherein the energy meter is selected from at least one of: a power meter and a water meter. 13. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: shielding the energy meter from adverse weather conditions. 14. A real time energy usage meter reader, comprising: means for mounting a meter reader sensor spaced apart from a utility meter; means for detecting speed of a rotating utility meter disk in the meter with the sensor; means for remotely transmitting in open air the speed of the rotating disk; and means for displaying energy usage that receives the open air speed transmission. 15. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the sensing means includes: means for sensing up to approximately 100 frame pictures per second of the rotating meter disk. 16. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the sensing means includes: means for sensing up to approximately 2300 frame pictures per second. 17. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the sensing means includes: a digital sensor camera. 18. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the mounting means includes: a rotatable arm mounted to a wall adjacent to the utility meter, the arm having a perpendicular position with the sensor attached to an end of the arm, and the sensor being adjacent to and above the meter, and the arm having an extended position with the sensor positioned away from the meter. 19. The meter reader of claim 18, wherein the mounting means further includes: means for sliding the sensor in a horizontal direction relative to the arm; and means for rotating the sensor relative to the end of the arm. 20. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the remotely transmitting means includes: a wireless transmitter with a non hardwired power source. 21. The meter reader of claim 20, wherein the power source includes: solar power. 22. The meter reader of claim 20, wherein the power source includes: a battery. 23. The meter reader of claim 15, wherein the displaying means includes: a liquid crystal(LCD) display. 24. The meter reader of claim 15, wherein the displaying means includes: means for displaying at least one of energy usage and energy billing costs. 25. The meter reader of claim 14, wherein the utility meter is selected from at least one of: a power meter and a water meter. 26. The meter reader of claim 18, further comprising: a protective shield for shielding the meter from adverse weather conditions.
