A high efficiency, environmentally friendly system comprising a plurality of photovoltaic solar collecting panels (PV panels) is disclosed. The system comprises an outer frame to which a plurality of inner frames are mounted to which the plurality of PV panels are attached. To minimize shadowing by the outer frame upon one or more PV panels, at least one PV panel may extend beyond an endpoint of the main frame. The system also comprises an outer frame rotation actuator that rotates the outer frame and an inner frame rotation actuator that rotates the inner frames and the plurality of PV panels. The solar tracking array frames disclosed herein help to improve the quality of the environment by conserving a variety of energy resources (e.g., fossil fuels, hydroelectric energy, etc.) The solar tracking array frames disclosed herein also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as solar tracking array frames do not produce carbon dioxide byproducts.Claims What is claimed is: 1.

The system of claim 1, further comprising a charge port upon which the system is mounted, wherein the first and second plurality of PV panels are configured to shade a vehicle as solar energy collected by the PV panels charges the vehicle. 12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a first actuator coupled to the first array and the second array and configured to rotate in unison the first plurality of PV panels about the X axes and the second plurality of PV panels about the X axes to provide solar tracking of the first and second plurality of PV panels on a daily basis. 13. The system of claim 12, wherein the first upper and lower rails at least partially define a first outer frame, and the second upper and lower rails at least partially define a second outer frame, and further comprising a second actuator coupled to the first outer frame and the second outer frame and configured to rotate in unison the first plurality of PV panels and the second plurality of PV panels about a Y axis that is substantially perpendicular to the X axes to provide solar tracking of the first and second plurality of PV panels on a seasonal basis. 14. The system of claim 13, further comprising a portable box that holds the first upper rail and first lower rail and the second upper rail and second lower rail, the first and second plurality of PV panels, the first actuator, the second actuator, and a power supply during a transportation process and acts as a mounting surface after the transportation process. 15. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a first actuator configured to rotate the first and second plurality of PV panels about their respective X axes between an easterly-facing position and a westerly-facing position to track a position of the sun on a daily basis; a second actuator configured to rotate the first upper rail and the first lower rail and the second upper rail and the second lower rail and the first and second plurality of PV panels about the Y axis between a northerly-facing position and southerly-facing position to track the position of the sun on a seasonal basis; one or more sensors operable to provide a signal representative of the position of the sun; one or more sensors operable to provide a signal representative of shadowing on one or more of the PV panels; and a controller having a microprocessor and configured to: (a) operate in a first tracking mode to provide instructions to the first actuator to move the first and second plurality of PV panels from the easterly-facing position toward the westerly-facing position to track the position of the sun from morning to evening, and (b) operate in a first backtracking mode to override the first tracking mode and provide instructions to the first actuator to move the first and second plurality of PV panels away from the easterly-facing position or the westerly-facing position until the first and second plurality of PV panels are substantially free of shadowing. 16.
