An electrically conductive mounting/grounding clip, for use with a photovoltaic assembly of the type having an electrically conductive frame, comprises an electrically conductive body. The body has a central portion and first and second spaced-apart arms extending generally perpendicular to the central portion. Each arm has an outer portion with each outer portion having an outer end. At least one frame surface-disrupting element is at each outer end. The central portion defines a plane with the frame surface-disrupting elements pointing towards the plane. In some examples each arm extends from the central portion at an acute angle to the plane.Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electrically conductive mounting/grounding clip for use with photovoltaic (PV) assemblies of a type having electrically conductive frames separated by gaps, the clip comprising: an electrically conductive body comprising a central portion and first and second spaced-apart arms extending generally perpendicular to the central portion; each arm having an outer portion, each outer portion having first and second outer ends; a frame surface-disrupting element at each outer end; the central portion defining a plane; each arm extending from the central portion at an acute angle to the plane; and the frame surface-disrupting elements pointing towards the plane. 2. The clip according to claim 1 wherein the frame surface-disrupting elements comprise frame-surface-penetrating teeth. 3. The clip according to claim 1 wherein the arms are generally T-shaped. 4. The clip according to claim 1 wherein the acute angle is 80-88.degree.. 5. The clip according to claim 1 wherein the acute angle is about 83.degree.. 6. The clip according to claim 1 further comprising a plurality of said frame surface-disrupting elements at each outer end. 7. The clip according to claim 6 wherein the frame surface-disrupting elements of each arm are oriented in a direction generally parallel to a line connecting the outer ends of said arm. 8. An electrically conductive mounting/grounding clip for use with photovoltaic (PV) assemblies of a type having electrically conductive frames separated by gaps, the clip comprising: an electrically conductive body comprising a central portion and first and second spaced-apart, generally T-shaped arms extending from the central portion; each arm extending from the central portion at an acute angle to the plane; each arm having an outer portion, each outer portion having first and second outer ends; a plurality of frame surface-disrupting elements at each outer end; the frame surface-disrupting elements of each arm being oriented in a direction generally parallel to a line connecting the outer ends of said arm; and the central portion defining a plane and the frame surface-disrupting elements pointing towards the plane. 9. An electrically conductive mounting/grounding clip assembly for use with a photovoltaic (PV) assembly of a type having electrically conductive frame, the clip assembly comprising: an electrically conductive clip comprising: a central portion and first and second spaced-apart arms extending from the central portion; each arm having an outer portion, each outer portion having an outer end; a frame surface-disrupting element at each outer end; the central portion defining a plane and the frame surface-disrupting elements pointing towards the plane; and each arm extending from the central portion at an acute angle to the plane; a second member supportable by a support element; means for (1) biasing the frame surface-disrupting elements of the clip against the electrically conductive frame of an adjacent PV assembly thereby electrically connecting the frame to the clip, and (2) securing the clip to the second member; means for preventing the clip from tipping away from the frame as the clip is biased against the frame by the biasing and securing means.
