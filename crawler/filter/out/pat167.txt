An integrated module frame and racking system for a solar panel is disclosed. The solar panel comprises a plurality of solar modules and a plurality of splices for coupling the plurality of solar modules together. The plurality of splices provide a way to make the connected modules mechanically rigid both during transport to the roof and after mounting for the lifetime of the system, provide wiring connections between modules, provide an electrical grounding path for the modules, provide a way to add modules to the panel, and provide a way to remove or change a defective module. Connector sockets are provided on the sides of the modules to simplify the electrical assembly of modules when the modules are connected together with splices.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar module comprising: a body portion having a frame; one or more splices, wherein each splice couples the frame of the body portion rigidly to a frame of the body portion of an adjacent solar module; a bracket that securely attaches the solar module to a roof wherein the bracket is located along any portion of the frame; wherein each splice further comprises a body for coupling the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together and a securing mechanism for securing the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together. 2. The solar module of claim 1, wherein the securing mechanism further comprises one of a screw, a cam type compression device, a press fit barb device, a toothed barb device, a spring clip attachment, a through pin and an expandable section at each end of the splice. 3. The solar module of claim 1 further comprising a coupling mechanism for coupling the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together, the coupling mechanism further comprises one of a screw, a cam type compression device, a press fit barb device, a toothed barb device, a spring clip attachment, a through pin and an expandable section at each end of the splice.
