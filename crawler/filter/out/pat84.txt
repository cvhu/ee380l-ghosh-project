The system of claim 1, wherein the wireless communication unit, remote terminal unit, I/O termination assembly, the uninterruptable power supply, the A/C terminal assembly, the surge protector, the low voltage distribution block and the converter disposed on the back plane are in a sealed watertight, water resistant top compartment. 3. The system of claim 1, wherein a seal is disposed in the bottom compartment forming a sealed watertight compartment for the at least 2 batteries and up to 8 batteries. 4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a ground fault interrupter disposed between the A/C terminal assembly and the uninterruptable power source. 5. The system of claim 1, further comprising a switch disposed between the A/C terminal assembly and the uninterruptable power source. 6. The system of claim 1, further comprising an outlet plug disposed between the A/C terminal assembly and the uninterruptable power source. 7. A portable self contained weather resistant low voltage flow control system comprising: a. at least two batteries; b. a wireless communications unit in communication with the at least two batteries; c. a remote terminal unit in communication with the wireless communication unit and the at least two batteries; d. an input/output (I/O) termination assembly providing connections for field equipment to the remote terminal unit; e. a remote terminal unit monitoring controller for monitoring and regulating a solar panel and for providing 10 volts to 30 volts of DC power to charge the at least two batteries; f. a solar array for receiving and distributing a continuous flow of electrical current to the remote terminal unit monitoring controller; g. a low voltage distribution block in communication with solar controller; and h. a DC-DC converter connected to the low voltage distribution block; i. an enclosure comprising a body with a movable door, an A/C terminal assembly mounted in the enclosure, and at least one movable door fastener to secure the movable door to the enclosure, wherein the movable door comprises a door extension and wherein the door extension is adapted to house a remote terminal unit monitoring controller in communication with a flow controller in communication with the A/C terminal assembly and at least one piece of field equipment; wherein the system provides continuous low voltage power to the remote terminal unit and the wireless communication unit to provide continuous communication for at least intermittent monitoring of field units. 8. The system of claim 7, wherein the solar array supplies between 10 volts to 30 volts of power using photovoltaics. 9. The system of claim 7, wherein the remoter terminal unit monitoring controller further comprises at least one volt meter for tracking voltage produced by the solar array. 10. The system of claim 9, wherein the remote terminal unit monitoring controller further comprises at least an indicator for illuminating when the solar array is charging, when a load is disconnected or combinations thereof.
