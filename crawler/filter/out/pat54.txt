The present invention comprises a tracking solar power array that provides shelter to items disposed beneath the solar power array, particularly to vehicles.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A shelter-providing solar tracking assembly comprising: at least one fixed support structure comprising: at least one support pillar, each said support pillar having a first end connected to a ground surface and extending substantially vertically along a longitudinal axis from said first end to a second end; a horizontal array support beam disposed at said second end of said at least one support pillar, said horizontal array support beam comprising a longitudinal axis substantially perpendicular to said longitudinal axis of said at least one support pillar; at least one drive assembly disposed at said second end of at least one of said support pillars, positioned collinear with said horizontal array support beam and comprising at least one drive assembly coupler tube; at least one rotor bearing assembly comprising at least one rotor bearing assembly coupler tube rotatable disposed in a sleeve bearing, said rotor bearing assembly coupler tube further rotatably disposed within a coupler torque tube and disposed at said second end of at least one of said support pillars; at least one solar power array disposed on said support structure comprising a plurality of solar panels comprising photovoltaic cells, said at least one solar power array moveable on a tracking axis and in communication with said drive assembly to track movement of the sun, said at least one solar power array forming an overhead canopy for at least one item disposed directly beneath said at least one solar power array, and providing electrical power to a building or structure located nearby; an inverter to convert energy from direct current to alternating current; and said at least one support pillar at a sufficient height to permit placement of the at least one item beneath said canopy without obstructing a movement of said at least one solar power array about said tracking axis. 2. The assembly of claim 1 further comprising a back-up generator. 3. The assembly of claim 1 further comprising at least one battery to store generated power. 4. The assembly of claim 1 further comprising at least one electric output connector. 5. The assembly of claim 1 wherein the item comprises at least one vehicle disposed directly beneath said at least one solar power array. 6. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said rotor bearing assembly is disposed at said second end of said at least one support pillar not having disposed thereon said drive assembly. 7. The assembly of claim 1 comprising at least two said solar power arrays and comprising at least two said support structures. 8. The assembly of claim 7 wherein said at least two support structures are connected to each other longitudinally. 9. The assembly of claim 6 comprising at least two said solar power arrays and at least two said support structures, wherein each end of each said horizontal support beam is connected to said drive assembly or to said rotor bearing assembly so that said at least two support structures are linked. 10. The assembly of claim 1 wherein the ground surface is parking for vehicles. 11. The assembly of claim 5 comprising a canopy for multiple vehicles. 12. The assembly of claim 11 wherein said canopy is a carport. 13. The assembly of claim 1 wherein the item is a car or truck. 14. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said at least one support pillar is made of concrete. 15. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said at least one drive assembly is attached to one end of said horizontal array support beam and disposed on a mounting plate at a juncture of said longitudinal axis of said horizontal support beam and said longitudinal axis of at least one of said at least one support pillar. 16. The assembly of claim 1 comprising multiple said solar power arrays moveable on a single axis. 17. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said axis is defined by said longitudinal tracking axis of said horizontal support beam. 18. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said sleeve bearing is attached to a bracket. 19. The assembly of claim 18 wherein said bracket is attached to a mounting plate. 20. The assembly of claim 19 wherein said mounting plate is attached to said at least one support pillar. 21. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said coupler torque tube is disposed perpendicular to an end plate. 22. The assembly of claim 21 wherein said end plate is attached to at least one end of said horizontal array support beam. 23. The drive assembly of claim 1 wherein said drive assembly coupler tube is attached to a coupler plate. 24. The assembly of claim 23 wherein a shroud is disposed adjacent to said coupler plate. 25. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said horizontal array support beam links to another horizontal array support beam via said rotor bearing assembly coupler tube. 26. The assembly of claim 1 wherein said horizontal array support beam links to another horizontal array support beam via said drive assembly coupler tube.
