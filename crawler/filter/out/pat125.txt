A solar roofing system includes components that can be made to mimic traditional tabbed asphalt roofing shingles in size, shape, and performance. Additionally, the shingles also include photovoltaic devices embedded in the shingle tabs. Shingles are installed in a traditional manner using traditional tools and fasteners in offset and overlapping rows. Electrical connectivity among tabs is made by contact between top and bottom surfaces of shingles without the need for additional wiring or hardware. The system includes multiple shingle shapes including a variation that can be cut apart into separate tabs. This solar roofing system can be integrated with non-photovoltaic components to fit irregularities found in a variety of roof surfaces. The system, once installed, creates a redundancy of electrical connectivity throughout a roof surface to allow for interruptions and irregularities in the roof surface and to allow for highly reliable output performance.Claims What is claimed is: 1.
