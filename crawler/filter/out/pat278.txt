The assembly of claim 5, wherein at least one of (i) the one or more rail structures, or (ii) the one or more strut runners are adjustable when mounted onto the underlying body so as to enable the assembly to be flexibly fitted onto the underlying body. 7. The assembly of claim 1, further comprising a compression mechanism that is manipulated to compress the retention structures in order to cause the retention structures to grip a corresponding solar module and to provide the corresponding module in a fixed position. 8. An assembly for mounting an array of solar modules on an inclined surface of an underlying body, wherein the assembly is installed over the underlying body and comprises: a plurality of rail structures that are arranged to form an overall perimeter for the assembly, the plurality of rail structures being extendable along a gradient of the incline to provide an up-gradient perimeter and a down-gradient perimeter; one or more retention structures provided with the plurality of rail structures to support one or more of the plurality of solar modules mounted thereon at a given height over the underlying body; and a channel that constrains air flow, the channel being formed at least in part by a flashing component included in each of the plurality of rail structures along the down-gradient perimeter of the array so as to enable the air flow to enter a space formed under the array by the plurality of rail members, the channel occupying at least a portion of the given height separating the one or more solar modules from the underlying structure. 9. The assembly of claim 8, wherein the channel is formed at least in part by at least some of the plurality of rail structures, and wherein the channel includes an opening for the exchange of air with an environment of the assembly; and wherein the channel is oriented to have one or more openings to receive airflow entering from at least one or more of the openings. 10. The assembly of claim 8, wherein at least one of (i) one or more of the rail structures, or (ii) the one or more retention structures are adjustable so as to adapt the assembly to accommodate solar modules of varying forms or dimensions. 11. The assembly of claim 8, further comprising one or more sealing features provided with the plurality of rail structures, wherein the one or more sealing features enable the individual rail structure to be sealed over the underlying body to constrain the airflow so as to form at least a portion of the channel. 12. The assembly of claim 8, wherein the flashing component forms at least a part of the channel and includes an underlying component that extends into or against the underlying body. 13. The assembly of claim 8, wherein the flashing component forms at least a part of the channel and includes an overlaying component that extends over the underlying flashing component. 14. The assembly of claim 8, further comprising one or more strut runners that extend directly over the underlying body and support the plurality of rail structures. 15. The assembly of claim 14, wherein at least one of (i) the one or more rail structures, or (ii) the one or more strut runners are adjustable when mounted onto the underlying body so as to enable the assembly to be flexibly fitted onto the underlying body. 16. The assembly of claim 11, wherein an overall perimeter of the assembly is rectangular, and wherein a portion of the overall perimeter is sealed with the underlying body and includes a majority of three lengths of the rectangle, and wherein the opening is provided at a remaining portion of the overall perimeter. 17. The assembly of claim 8, further comprising a compression mechanism that is manipulated to compress the retention structures in order to cause the retention structures to grip a corresponding solar module and to provide the corresponding module in a fixed position. 18. The assembly of claim 17, wherein one or more of the plurality of rail structures include an interior surface from which one or more corresponding retention structures are provided, and wherein each of the one or more rail structures is provided a shim plate on an exterior surface that forms the portion of the overall perimeter so as to support that rail structure when compressed by the compression mechanism.
