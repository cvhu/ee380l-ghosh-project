A direct current to pulse amplitude modulated ("PAM") current converter, denominated a "PAMCC", is connected to an individual source of direct current. The PAMCC receives direct current and provides pulse amplitude modulated current at its output. The pulses are produced at a high frequency relative to the signal modulated on a sequence of pulses. The signal modulated onto a sequence of pulses may represent portions of a lower frequency sine wave or other lower frequency waveform, including DC. When the PAMCC's output is connected in parallel with the outputs of similar PAMCCs an array of PAMCCs is formed, wherein the output pulses of the PAMCCs are out of phase with respect to each other. An array of PAMCCs constructed in accordance with the present invention form a distributed multiphase inverter whose combined output is the demodulated sum of the current pulse amplitude modulated by each PAMCC.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A system for converting electrical power, the system comprising: two or more direct electrical current sources; a pulse amplitude modulated current converter ("converter") connected to each direct electrical current source, wherein each of the converters receives direct electrical current from its respective direct electrical current source and provides pulse amplitude modulated current pulses at an output terminal of the converter and further wherein the output terminal of each converter is electrically connected in parallel with the output terminals of all of the other converters in the system and further wherein the current pulses of at least two converters are out of phase with respect to each other, thereby summing the current pulses of all of the converters such that a signal modulated onto the pulse output of the converters is demodulated. 2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the current pulse of each converter is out of phase with respect to the current pulses of all other converters. 3. The system according to claim 1 wherein the signal is a sixty-cycle alternating current voltage. 4. The system according to claim 1 wherein the signal is an approximately fixed value of direct current voltage. 5. The system according to claim 1 wherein the two or more direct electrical current sources are photovoltaic panels. 6. The system according to claim 1, wherein a communications signal is superimposed upon the signal.
