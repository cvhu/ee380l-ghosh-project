A solar inverter assembly has a first housing part, which is used as a heat sink, and a second housing part for holding electronic components of the solar inverter. The first housing part has a first air inlet opening, a first air outlet opening and a first air channel connecting the air inlet and air outlet openings. Air flows on the basis of natural convection through the first air channel. The second housing part has a second air inlet opening, a second air outlet opening, and a second air channel which connects the second air inlet opening to the second air outlet opening. Air flows on the basis of natural convection through the second air channel. At least one electronic component, which is insensitive to dust, of the solar converter, for example a transformer or an inductor, is mounted in the second housing part in direct thermal contact with the first housing part and within the second air channel. Those electronic components of the solar inverter that are sensitive to dust are in contrast arranged in the second housing part, separated in a dust-tight manner by a separating wall from the second air channel, and make indirect thermal contact with the first housing part. A solar inverter such as this ensures high cooling power for its electronic components, and at the same time the high ingress-protection class.Claims The invention claimed is: 1.
