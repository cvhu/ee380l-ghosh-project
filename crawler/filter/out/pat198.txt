Renewable electrical energy is provided with aspects and circuitry that can harvest maximum power from an alternative electrical energy source (1) such as a string of solar panels (11) for a power grid (10). Aspects include: i) controlling electrical power creation from photovoltaic DC-AC inverter (5), ii) operating photovoltaic DC-AC inverter (5) at maximal efficiency even when MPP would not be, iii) protecting DC-AC inverter (5) so input can vary over a range of insolation and temperature, and iv) providing dynamically reactive capability to react and assure operation, to permit differing components, to achieve code compliant dynamically reactive photovoltaic power control circuitry (41). With previously explained converters, inverter control circuitry (38) or photovoltaic power converter functionality control circuitry (8) configured as inverter sweet spot converter control circuitry (46) can achieve extraordinary efficiencies with substantially power isomorphic photovoltaic capability at 99.2% efficiency or even only wire transmission losses.
