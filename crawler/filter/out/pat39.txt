A method for the startup of a solar power three-phase inverter in which a waiting period is increased between successive attempts to start the inverter. This method allows the inverter to start up in a reasonable amount of time while avoiding excessive cycling during prolonged periods of low light.Claims What is claimed is: 1. A method of operating a three-phase inverter connected to a photovoltaic panel, the method comprising: a) monitoring a DC voltage input to the inverter and waiting for a DC voltage to exceed a predetermined value for the DC voltage, keeping the inverter shut down until the DC voltage exceeds the predetermined value for the DC voltage; b) operating the inverter for a first predetermined period of time before checking the DC voltage and a DC power level; c) interrupting operation of the inverter when the DC voltage is below the predetermined value for the DC voltage or when the DC power level is below a predetermined value for the DC power level; d) if operation of the inverter is interrupted then waiting for a second predetermined period of time before resuming operation of the inverter; and e) repeating steps (c) and (d) and increasing the second predetermined period of time between successive resumptions of operation. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the second predetermined period of time decreases to first predetermined period of time after a predetermined number of startup attempts. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the second predetermined period of time follows a pattern of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes and then back to 5 minutes to repeat the pattern. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the second predetermined period of time reaches a maximum value after a predetermined number of startup attempts and is held at the maximum value for successive startup attempts.
