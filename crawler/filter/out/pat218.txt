The photovoltaic system includes a plurality of photovoltaic modules which are connected to form a string or several strings connected in parallel, thereby forming a photovoltaic generator having a positive terminal and negative terminal. A DC constant voltage source connected to the photovoltaic generator to raise the potential of the positive terminal relative to ground potential. This reduces the flow of electrons out of the TCO layer of the modules, thereby reducing or completely eliminating cathode discharges which damage the modules.Claims What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims and includes equivalents of the elements recited therein: 1. A photovoltaic system comprising: a photovoltaic generator comprising a plurality of photovoltaic modules electrically connected in form of at least one string, with a first terminal of the photovoltaic generator having a first potential of negative polarity and a second terminal of the photovoltaic generator having a second potential of positive polarity, and a device comprising a DC voltage source having a negative terminal connected to ground and a positive terminal which is connected to one of the first or second terminal of the photovoltaic generator for raising the first or second potential relative to ground. 2. The photovoltaic system of claim 1, further comprising a potential-free inverter having a DC input terminals connected to the terminals of the photovoltaic generator in one-to-one correspondence. 3. The photovoltaic system of claim 1, wherein the DC voltage source is a constant voltage source having a predetermined output voltage. 4.
