A skyline imaging system includes an image sensor and an inclination reference coupled to the image sensor. The inclination reference provides a righting moment for the image sensor and establishes a predetermined orientation for the image sensor relative to the Earth's gravity vector. A heading reference determines an azimuth heading for the image sensor.Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A skyline imaging system, comprising: an image sensor; a heading reference determining an azimuth heading for the image sensor; and an inclination reference coupled to the image sensor providing for pivotal mounting of the image sensor about at least one pivot axis within a housing, wherein the image sensor acquires an orientation-referenced image of a skyline within a field of view that is offset from the Earth's gravity vector. 2. The skyline imaging system of claim 1 wherein providing the field of view that is offset from the Earth's gravity vector increases centering of one or more paths that the Sun traverses on at least one of a daily and a seasonal timescale within the field of view of the image sensor, relative to a field of view that is aligned with the Earth's gravity vector. 3. The skyline imaging system of claim 1 wherein the inclination reference includes a one-dimensional gimbal having a single pivot axis. 4.
