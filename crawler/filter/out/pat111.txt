The present invention comprises an electrical connector device for electrically connecting an alternating current ("AC") photovoltaic ("PV") solar panel device having an integral micro-inverter to the utility grid. The electrical connector device is a compression connector fitting that includes an upper and lower housing, which each include a channel for receiving the main electrical conductor line. The electrical connector device further includes three electrical prong, which are designed to pierce and penetrate the insulation of the main electrical conductor line to establish an electrical connection between the micro-inverter and the utility grid, when the electrical connector device is compressed about the main electrical conductor line. The shape of the channel formed in the electrical connector device has a distinctive cross-sectional shape that substantially corresponds to the shape of the main electrical conductor line to insure proper alignment and orientation of the main conductor line within the connector device.Claims I claim: 1. A connector device for establishing an AC electrical connection between a solar panel and a utility grid comprising: a housing having a channel formed therethrough and having three prongs extending into said channel, said three prongs being electrically connected to an AC electrical output of a micro-inverter device integral to said solar panel; wherein said three prongs establish an electrical connection between said micro-inverter device and a conductor line, which is electrically connected to said utility grid, by piercing and penetrating said conductor line when said housing is compressed about said conductor line. 2. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said housing comprises an upper and a lower portion for capturing said conductor line therebetween. 3. The connector device of claim 2, wherein said upper and lower portion each have a portion of said channel formed therein. 4. The connector device of claim 2, wherein said upper and lower portions of said housing snap together in a compressive bond. 5. The connector device of claim 2, wherein said upper and lower portions of said housing are joined with adhesive bonding. 6. The connector device of claim 2, wherein said upper portion further comprises a screw fastener which corresponds to a threaded insert formed it said lower portion for compressing said housing about said conductor line. 7. The connector device of claim 6, wherein said screw fastener is captured within said upper portion. 8. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said upper portion has a first slot formed therein which corresponds to a second slot formed in said lower portion to assist in properly aligning said upper portion to said lower portion. 9. The connector device of claim 8, further comprising an alignment insert which fits in said first and second slots to properly align said upper portion to said lower portion. 10. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said channel has a geometric cross-section that is substantially similar to a geometric cross section of said conductor line. 11. The connector device of claim 10, wherein said geometric cross-section of said conductor line includes two opposing sides with dissimilar geometric shapes to assist in aligning said conductor line in said channel. 12. The connector device of claim 11, wherein said cross-section of said conductor line has one side that is squared off and an opposing side that is rounded. 13. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said prongs are laterally spaced across the width of said channel. 14. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said prongs are spaced at intervals along the length of said channel. 15. The connector device of claim 1, further comprising a sealing mechanism on said upper and lower portions that is moisture and dust resistant. 16. The connector device of claim 15, wherein said sealing mechanism comprises interlocking corresponding lips on the periphery of said upper and lower portions. 17. The connector device of claim 1, wherein said conductor line comprises three conductor wires encased in an insulative jacket. 18. The connector device of claim 17, wherein said insulative jacket is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). 19. The connector device of claim 17, wherein each of said conductor wires are sheathed in an insulative coating. 20. The connector device of claim 15, wherein said insulative coating is cross-linked polyethylene.
