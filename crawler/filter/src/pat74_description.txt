Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is related to a mounting structure, particularly to a solar panel mounting structure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Solar panels for use in commercial and residential environments are known. Solar panels are typically mounted on a mounting structure, which is supported on a mounting surface. Existing mounting structures are often overly complicated and cost much to be manufactured. U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,599 to Eiden et al. discloses solar tracking control system selectively energizes and de-energizes a motor. However, Eiden et al. requires a complicated circuit to control the motor's rotation with clockwise and counterclockwise so as to control the solar panel frame turning corresponding to the sun tracking. An objective of the present invention is to provide a solar panel mounting structure that uses simple and durable mechanical movement. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a solar panel mounting structure that is manufactured inexpensively. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, a solar panel mounting structure comprises: a frame has a first opening, a second opening and a third opening, and connects to a solar panel; the third opening is aligned with the first opening and the second opening; a first gear has a first bar; the first bar works in the first opening; a second gear has a second bar; the second bar works in the second opening; and a third gear has an axle, and locates between the first gear and the second gear and gearing therein; the axle works in the third opening; thereby, the solar panel seesaws by the axle when the third gear turns. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the first gear connects a first disk; the first disk locates between the first gear and the frame; the first bar connects to a side of the first disk. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the second gear connects a second disk; the second disk locates between the second gear and the frame; the second bar connects to a side of the second disk. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a first holder connects to the first gear; a second holder connects to second gear; a third holder connects to the third gear; thereby, the first holder, the second holder and the third holder fix on a building or the ground. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the first opening is long; the second opening is long; the third opening is circular. The present invention may best be understood through the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates one application on the ground according to the present invention; FIG. 2 illustrates the mounting structure for solar panel according to the present invention; FIG. 3 illustrates the decomposed one according to FIG. 3; and FIG. 4 illustrates another mounting structure for solar panel according to the present invention; FIG. 5 illustrates the decomposed one according to FIG. 4; FIGS. 6(A)(B)(C)(D) illustrates the solar panel turns by the gears according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 illustrates one application on the ground according to the present invention. There are a sun 11, a solar panel 12 and a holder 14 in FIG. 1. When the sun move from position P1 to P2, the solar panel 12 will turns from angle A1 to A2 so as to track the sun and maximize the energy collecting from the sun. FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 illustrate the mounting structure for solar panel according to the present invention. There are a frame 31, two long opening 311,312, a circular opening 313 (showed in FIG. 3), three gears 321,322,323, two bars 341,342, three holders 351,352,353, where the three holders 351,352, and 353 is adjustable. The frame 31 can fix a solar panel thereon. When the frame turns, the solar panel will turn thereby. The frame has two long openings 311,312 and one circular opening 313. The bar 341 connected to gear 321 works in the long opening 311, and the bar 342 connected to gear 322 works in the long opening 312. The axel of the gear 323 works in the circular opening 313. FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 illustrate another mounting structure for solar panel according to the present invention. There are a frame 31, two long opening 311,312, a circular opening 313 (showed in FIG. 5), three gears 321,322,323, two disks 331,332, two bars 341,342, three holders 351,352,353, where the three holders 351,352, and 353 is adjustable. The frame 31 can fix a solar panel thereon. When the frame turns, the solar panel will turn thereby. The frame has two long openings 311,312 and one circular opening 313. The bar 341 connected to disk 331 works in the long opening 311, and the bar 342 connected to disk 332 works in the long opening 312. The axel of the gear 323 works in the circular opening 313. The gears 321, 322 connect to disks 331, 332 respectively. The disks 331, 332 can make a large slope degree to track the sun. When the gear 323 turns with counterclockwise, the gears 331 and 332 will turn with clockwise so as to seesaw the frame. Certainly, the movement is driven by an AC motor or DC motor. The motor can rotate to turn the gear 323, and then make the gear 321 and 322 turn so as to seesaw the solar panel and track the sun easily. The motor can be set with rotation frequency and rotation clock to meet the tracking requirement. As long as the clockwise turning and the counterclockwise turning are controlled in each 12 hours respectively, the solar panel can produce the maximum performance. FIGS. 6(A)(B)(C)(D) illustrate the solar panel turns by the gears according to the present invention. The dotted line shows the frame seesaws by the gears 321,322,323. To sum up, the present invention improves the conventional technique by the designs of three gears and one frame with three openings. The advantages is as follows: 1. The device provides the ability for mounted solar panel to seesaw in different angles according to the moving track of the sun in order to collect the maximum sunlight during daytime. 2. By using mechanical movement, this device is easily controlled and more durable, comparing to complicated circuit. 3. With simple structure, this device is manufactured inexpensively. 4. The diameters of three gears are adjustable for turning different angles in different areas. While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention need not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures. * * * * *
