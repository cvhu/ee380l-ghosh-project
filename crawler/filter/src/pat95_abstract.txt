In one embodiment, the present invention includes a roof support apparatus which may be used for securing a load to a tile-covered roof. The roof support apparatus comprises a mounting plate, a first and second attachment member, an upper support member, and a load. The mounting plate engages its base with an upper surface of the roof. A track of the mounting plate extends parallel to the base and has a width less than a width of said base. The first and second attachment members are adapted to extend downward through an exposed surface of the base on both sides of the track. The upper support member is adapted to pass vertically upward through an opening in a roof covering material, such as tile, and engage a screw which may slide along the tack until the screw and the upper support member are fully engaged.
