At least one embodiment relates to data processing and transferring in a multi computer environment for reporting, monitoring, and predicting the supply, demand, and generation of alternative energy on a global scale. The system is configured to collect past and present alternative energy generation and distribution data from a variety of distributed sources. Example of such distributed data producing sources may include any of various power installations and systems, power sources, and billing systems. The data collected from these sources is stored and contemplated in a central database unit. Based on the data contemplated in the central database unit, the system, further, makes predictions of present and future generations, supply, and demand of alternative energy at local, regional, national, and global scales. Using these predictions, the system recommends changes in the existing energy generation resources, and/or proposes deployment of new energy generation resources.
