An inverter is devised to avoid high-frequency voltages at input terminals and to allow good efficiency thanks to its simple and cost-optimized circuit layout. This is achieved by a method of converting a direct current voltage, more specifically from a photovoltaic source of direct current voltage, into an alternating current voltage at a frequency through a bridge circuit comprising switching elements (V1-V 4) and free-wheeling elements (D1-D4), said switching elements (V1-V4) being on the one side gated at the frequency and on the other side clocked at a high clock rate, a direct current voltage circuit, an alternating current voltage circuit and a plurality of free-wheeling phases being provided. It is provided that, during the free-wheeling phases, the alternating current voltage circuit is decoupled from the direct current voltage circuit by means of a switching element disposed in the direct current voltage circuit, a free-wheeling current flowing through one of the free-wheeling elements (D1) in the bridge circuit when in the decoupled state.
