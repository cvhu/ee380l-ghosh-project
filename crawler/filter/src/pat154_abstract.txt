A connector assembly includes a housing, a contact, a support plate, and posts. The housing extends between a mounting side and an opposite side. The mounting side is configured to be mounted to a first side of a photovoltaic module. The contact is held by the housing and is configured to be electrically coupled with the photovoltaic module. The support plate is configured to be mounted to a second side of the photovoltaic module. The posts are coupled with at least one of the housing and the support plate and extend through an opening in the photovoltaic module that extends therethrough and joined with the other of the housing and the support plate. The posts secure the housing to the photovoltaic module.
