A solar tracker has a mounting surface to which a solar device is mounted and means for causing the mounting surface to change its orientation so as to be substantially perpendicular to the sun's rays as the sun travels through a useful arc relative to the solar tracker wherein change of orientation of the mounting surface is caused by bending of the solar tracker attributable. The bending can be caused by mechanical contraction or due to shrinkage caused by loss of water in which case capillary action causes the outer surface material to be saturated and grow when it is not exposed to sunlight. The bendable mounting surface support is an elongated tube held in a nominally vertical position in the absence of sunlight by a vertical support which can be a coiled compression spring, an extruded tube of closed-end structural foam, a vertical floating pole or an air-inflated tube.
