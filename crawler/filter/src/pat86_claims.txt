Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A system for removably and adjustably mounting a photovoltaic module or flat panel to a surface, comprising: a rail formed with two or more tracks, wherein the rail is formed of extruded aluminum and further comprises a cavity substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rail; and means for connecting the rail to the said photovoltaic module or flat panel, wherein the rail is formed with a body having a proximal end, a distal end, opposing sides, and a hollow chamber extending the length of the rail substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rail, and further wherein the cavity is formed in the side of the hollow chamber through one of the opposing sides, and further wherein the means for connecting the rail to said photovoltaic module or flat panel is one or more connector brackets demountably attachable to the rail and to the object, and monolithically formed with a first flange and a second flange substantially at a right angle, wherein the first flange is formed with a lip. 2. A system for removably and adjustably mounting a photovoltaic module or flat panel on a surface as recited in claim 1, wherein the first flange is formed with a bore. 3. A system for removably and adjustably mounting a photovoltaic module or flat panel on a surface as recited in claim 1, wherein the one or more connector brackets are removably engageable with said cavity formed in the side of said hollow chamber.
