In a first embodiment a framed solar panel is retained by a rod inserted through a hole in the panel frame. The rod is attached to the top of a bracket, which is mounted at its bottom to a substantially flat surface. In a second embodiment, a framed solar collector panel is retained by a clip which is designed to fit over the top edge of the frame. The clip is then attached to the top of a second bracket. In a fourth embodiment a tether is fastened between the through hole and the flat surface. These embodiments may be used at either or both ends of the frame. Each embodiment may include a safety tether that is connected between the frame and the bracket.
