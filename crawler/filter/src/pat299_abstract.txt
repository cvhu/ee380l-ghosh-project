Method and apparatus for monitoring, measuring and recording the operating values of each of a plurality of inter-connected AC PV modules and performing a diagnostic analysis, including comparing the those operating values to each other and to operating values recorded at an earlier time to determine laminate degradation and the performance-attenuating effect of temperature, soiling, shading, and snow cover on the modules.
