Power consumption at a site is monitored. An electrical load is connected to a power source by an electrical conductor. A fuel-less energy producing device is electrically connected to a junction along the electrical conductor. A current sensor is electromagnetically coupled to the electrical conductor at a sensing position between the power source and the junction to create a current sensor signal. Sensed current and voltage signals are produced from the current sensor signal. A sensed phase relationship between the sensed signals is determined and compared to a baseline phase relationship to determine the direction of current flow through the conductor. A power source signal, based on the current flowing through the conductor at the sensing position, is created. With some examples a Rogowski type differential current sensor is used. In some examples a single current sensor is used.
