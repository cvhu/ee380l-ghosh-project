Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to energy monitoring and more particularly to a system and computer program product for implementing a smart transformer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Due in part to the technology of Electric Vehicles, and other Smart Grid opportunities, the loads of the future are expected to be vastly different from the loads of today. As such, utilities may begin to see daily peaks move, or level out, due to the expected increased loading patterns. Although the full system load is an issue, the problem at hand concerns the load specific to an individual distribution transformer. Currently, transformer sizing in residential applications may be based on a number of assumptions. One assumption may entail an average load based on home size, while a second assumption may entail a peak period (e.g., four hours). As a result of the charging of electric vehicles, the amount of load on a distribution transformer could potentially double, as well as increase the peak period to well past four hours. Accordingly, an increased loss of life in distribution transformers is expected going forward, as well as a much greater potential for transformer failure. Currently, there is no known way of monitoring and controlling the real-time load on a distribution transformer. Overload situations may be detected in two ways. In some cases, a customer calls in with voltage issues, sparking an investigation and subsequent upgrade of the transformer in the case that it is overloaded. In cases where the transformer fails, may be upgraded if overloading is the expected cause. Both cases involve treating the problem with reactionary measures. As such, a proactive solution is sought that uses Smart Grid technology with the goal of running the system in the most efficient and cost effective way possible. BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed toward a system and computer program product for implementing a smart transformer. The system and computer program product are configured to monitor and control electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of distribution transformers. One embodiment of the invention involves a system for implementing a smart transformer, comprising a processor, and a balancing algorithm residing on the processor, wherein the balancing algorithm is stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium having computer executable program code embodied thereon, the computer executable program code configured to cause the system to monitor and control an electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of a distribution transformer, wherein the processor receives a plurality of system inputs and uses the balancing algorithm to determine a rating of the transformer and an amount of customer load. In some embodiments, the plurality of system inputs may comprise five or more inputs selected from the group consisting of: system load; transformer load; transformer type, size, and vintage; humidity; ambient temperature of transformer; transformer OPS location; price signals; individual customer load; specific equipment load; distributed generation output and type; voltage; and date/time. In operation, the processor uses the balancing algorithm to determine an optimum dispatch of load that will prevent overload of the distribution transformer. The processor receives a plurality of user inputs comprising two or more user inputs selected from the group consisting of: loading guidelines; interval; nameplate KVA; and voltage. The loading guidelines include % rated KVA allowed as a decimal based on hot spot temperature, oil temperature, and ambient temperature. The above-described system may further comprise a distribution transformer monitor for measuring at least the current, voltage, and ambient temperature of the transformer. In some cases, the processor receives distributed generation values representing all customer distributed generation off of the transformer including at least photovoltaic systems and battery storage. The processor send a busy signal to the customer if the current load is exceeding the loading guidelines, and distributed generation is unavailable. In some embodiments, the transformer is placed in a waiting mode if the processor detects a possible transformer overload, whereby the processor is thereby blocked from normal operation. Device priority is used to determine when the transformer moves out of the waiting mode and is allowed to resume normal operation. Another embodiment of the present invention involves a non-transitory computer readable medium having computer executable program code embodied thereon, the computer executable program code configured to cause a processor to monitor and control an electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of a distribution transformer, by performing the steps of (i) receiving a plurality of system inputs; (ii) utilizing a balancing algorithm to determine a rating of the transformer and an amount of customer load; and (iii) utilizing the balancing algorithm to determine an optimum dispatch of load that will prevent overload of the distribution transformer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS THE INVENTION The present invention is directed toward a system and computer program product for implementing a smart transformer. The system and computer program product are configured to monitor and control electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of distribution transformers. FIG. 1 is a diagram depicting the basic system architecture of a system 10 and computer program product for implementing a smart transformer, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system 10 includes a balancing algorithm 12 residing on a processor 15 and a database 18 for storing various system, utility and customer information. In particular, the balancing algorithm 12 is stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium having computer executable program code embodied thereon, the computer executable program code configured to cause the system to monitor and control electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of distribution transformers. In the illustrated embodiment, various inputs to the system include, but are not limited to: (i) System Load 20, (ii) Transformer Load 25, (iii) Transformer Type, Size, and Vintage 30, (iv) Humidity 35 (present and historical), (v) Ambient Temperature 40 of transformer (present and historical), (vi) Transformer GPS Location 45 (vii) Price Signals 50, (viii) Individual Customer Load 55 (total per house), (ix) Specific Equipment Load 60 (e.g., electric vehicle charging), (x) Distributed Generation Output and Type 65, (xi) Voltage 70, and (xii) Date/Time 75. As would be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, any number of additional system inputs may be employed without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, some embodiments of the invention may entail a similar system having only a subset of the system inputs depicted in FIG. With further reference to FIG. 1, the processor 15 receives the various system inputs 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and uses the balancing algorithm 12 to determine the rating of the transformer and the amount of customer load. Then, the processor 15 uses the balancing algorithm 12 to determine the optimum dispatch of load which will prevent overload of the distribution transformer, while minimizing impact to the customer. Communications may take place using Home Automation Network (HAN) devices or other means of communication. According to various embodiments of the invention, user inputs may include, but are not limited to: (i) Loading Guidelines, (ii) Interval, (iii) Nameplate KVA (Kilovolt-Ampere), and (iv) Voltage. The appropriate utility may set the Loading Guidelines, which may include, e.g., % rated KVA allowed as a decimal based on Hot Spot Temperature, Oil Temperature, and Ambient Temperature. Of course, the Loading Guidelines will vary based upon whether the transformer is a (i) Single Phase UG Transformer, (ii) Pole Mount Transformer (4 hour Peak Load Profile), or (iii) Pole Mount Transformer (8 hour Peak Load Profile). In some embodiments, the Hot Spot Temperature, Oil Temperature, and Ambient Temperature values are automatically associated with each system transformer within the database 18 such that the appropriate Loading Guidelines may be selected while "balancing" the transformer. Another user input may comprise Interval, which can be defined as how often the utility would like the "Interval Process" to run. With respect to Nameplate KVA, the utility should ensure that this value is stored in the database 18 for each transformer on the system. Regarding Voltage, the utility should ensure that the secondary voltage level is stored in the database 18 for each transformer on the system. FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an Interval Process 100 for monitoring and controlling electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of a distribution transformer. Specifically, operation 110 involves loading the Loading Guidelines, INT (Interval), VOLT (Voltage) and KVA (Kilovolt-Ampere) into the system 10 of FIG. 1. Operation 120 entails starting the program by running the algorithm 18 residing on the processor 15. In operation 130, the system 10 retrieves the GPS location of the transformer and saves it with a timestamp. Operation 140 entails exporting the GPS and timestamp data to the Database 18. In operation 150, the system 10 determines whether Hot Spot data is available. If so, the system uses Hot Spot Loading Guidelines for the Interval Process 100 in operation 160. If the Hot Spot data is unavailable in operation 150, the system 10 determines whether Oil Temperature data is available in operation 180. If so, the system uses Oil Temperature Loading Guidelines for the Interval Process 100 in operation 190. If the Oil Temperature data is unavailable in operation 180, the system 10 retrieves an ambient temperature reading (in Celsius) in operation 200 based upon input from a Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM), and exports the temperature reading to the database 18 in operation 220. The DIM is a device for measuring at least the current, voltage, and ambient temperature at the transformer level. With further reference to FIG. 2, operation 230 involves manipulating Nameplate KVA by adding 0.01 KVA for each degree C. below 30.degree. C. and subtracting 0.015 KVA for each degree below 30.degree. C. In operation 240, if the forecast for the Interval is higher than the current temperature (based upon a weather forecast input for a given Interval in operation 250), the system 10 re-manipulates according to the forecast. Operation 255 involves retrieving Smart Load information from each service point, including Hot Spot Loading Guidelines, Oil Temperature Loading Guidelines, and Nameplate KVA data. In addition, input from the customer equipment (e.g., EV and HVAC) is transmitted to the system 10 in operation 260. In operation 270, the Smart Load information is exported to the database 18. Operation 280 entails the system 10 receiving Smart Generation (DistGen) production and availability values for each service point, wherein additional input is received from the customer equipment (operation 290), and wherein the Smart Generation data is exported to the database 18 (operation 300). The Smart Generation values for each service point may also be referred to herein as Distributed Generation (DistGen) values representing all customer distributed generation off of a particular transformer (e.g., photovoltaic systems, battery storage, etc.). In operation 310, the system 10 retrieves current load at the transformer including input from the DTM (operation 320). In operation 330, the current load data is exported to the database 18. Operation 340 entails determining whether the current load is exceeding the Loading Guidelines. If so, operation 350 involves the system 10 determining whether there is available Distributed Generation (DistGen). If DistGen is unavailable, the system 10 sends an alarm to the utility and starts a Busy Signal in operation 355. The Busy Signal may be used to communicate to the customer that it is not advisable to add load to the system at that particular time. In some cases, the Busy Signal may be sent to the customer when the transformer load has reached a point of maximum desired capacity. However, if DistGen is available in operation 350, the system 10 connects DistGen until the transformer is within the Loading Guidelines, or no further DistGen is available (operation 360). Operation 370 entails the system 10 determining whether current loading is now within Loading Guidelines. If not, the system 10 determines whether current loading is above the emergency maximum load in operation 380. If the emergency maximum load has not been exceeded, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 355, whereby the system 10 sends an alarm to the customer and starts the Busy Signal. However, in cases where the emergency maximum load has been exceeded, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 400, whereby the system 10 sends out an Emergency Busy Signal to shut down available load to the transformer, and the system 10 proceeds to send an alarm to the customer and start the Busy Signal (operation 355). With continued reference to FIG. 2, operations 410 and 415 entail the system 10 determining whether any devices are in a waiting mode. If so, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 420, wherein the system 10 determines whether the top priority waiting device has a load that is less than [RatedKVA-CurrentKVA]. If so, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 430, wherein the system 10 connects the top priority, waiting load and adds the load value to the current load. In Operation 440, the system, 10 determines whether there is another device in waiting mode. It so, the Interval Process 100 returns to operation 420, wherein the system 10 again determines whether the top priority waiting device has a load that is less than [RatedKVA-CurrentKVA]. If not, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 450, and the system determines whether there is any available DistGen. In the case where no DistGen is available, the device is left in waiting mode (operation 460). How if DistGen is available, the Interval Process 100 moves to step 470, wherein the system 10 determines whether the available DistGen is sufficient to carry the top priority waiting load. If not, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 460. If enough DistGen is available, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 430. When there are no longer any devices in waiting mode (per determinations in operations 410, 415, or 440), or following a Busy Signal being send to the customer (in operation 355), the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 500, wherein the system 10 retrieves a voltage read based upon input from the DTM (operation 510). In operation 520 the system 10 determines whether the voltage is 5% of VOLT. If not, the system retrieves historical voltage reacts (operation 530) based upon input voltage reads from the database 18 (operation 540). Operation 550 entails the system 10 determining whether the voltage has been outside of the +/-5% range for more than X hours. If not, a low priority alarm is sent to the utility in operation 560. However, if the range has been exceeded for X hours in operation 560, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 570, wherein the system 10 retrieves the order history for the particular location using the input order history from the company database (operation 580). With further reference to FIG. 2, operation 590 entails the system 10 determining whether an order has been sent in the last N days. If not, a high priority alarm is sent to the utility ism operation 600. Operation 610 involves the system 10 creating a voltage order for the location. Subsequent to creation of the voltage order (operation 610), or if the voltage within +/-5% of VOLT in operation 520, or if an order has been sent in the last N days in operation 590, the Interval Process 100 proceeds to operation 630, in which the voltage read is exported to the database 18. The Interval Process terminates at operation 640. FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating an Instantaneous Process 700 for monitoring and controlling electric customer load and generation in order to optimize the performance of a distribution transformer. Specifically, in operation 710, a new Smart Load comes on line or a device is now at high priority on the waiting mode. In operation 720, the system 10 adds the new load to the current load from the last interval. Operation 730 entails the system 10 determining whether the Busy Signal is turned on. If not, the Instantaneous Process 700 proceeds to operation 740, wherein the system 10 determines whether the current load exceeds the Loading Guidelines. If the Busy Signal is turned in operation 730, or the current load exceeds the Loading Guidelines in operation 740, the Instantaneous Process 700 proceeds to operation 750, wherein the system 10 sends a Busy Signal to the customer. Operation 760 entails the system determining whether the new load is high priority. If not, the system 10 determines in operation 770 whether the customer has hit the over-ride button. If not, the system 10 disconnects the new load, subtracts this from the current load, and sets the device to waiting mode (operation 780). However, if the customer has hit the panic button in operation 770, or if the new load is on high priority in operation 760, then the Instantaneous Process 700 proceeds to operation 790, wherein the system 10 determines whether a low priority load is currently connected. If so, the system disconnects the low priority loads until the addition of the new load is within Loading Guidelines, or all low priority loads have been disconnected and put on waiting mode (operation 800). Operation 810 entails the system 10 sending a Busy Signal to the impacted customers with a message that low priority loads have been disconnected. With further reference to FIG. 3, operation 820 involves the system, 10 determining whether the transformer is still above Loading Guidelines. If so, or if there are no low priority loads connected in operation 790, the Instantaneous Process 700 proceeds to operation 830, wherein the system 10 determines whether the current loading is above the emergency maximum load. If so, the system 10 sends an Emergency Busy Signal to shut down available load (operation 840), and sends an alarm to the utility (operation 850). If the current is not above the emergency maximum load in operation 830, the Instantaneous Process 700 proceeds directly to operation 850. Operation 860 entails exporting overload information to the database 18. Id the transformer is not above Loading Guidelines in operation 820, or the current load does not exceed Loading Guidelines in operation 740, or after setting the transformer to waiting mode in operation 780, the Instantaneous Process 700 ends at operation 900. According to various embodiments of the invention, the system 10 may include a Waiting Mode. In some cases, customer equipment that is in the Waiting Mode is plugged into the grid at the customer premises, but blocked from operation via the system 10 due to a possible overload of the transformer. The device Priority determines when the equipment moves out of Waiting Mode and is allowed to resume normal operation. In some embodiments, all customer equipment that is controlled by the system 10 has a Priority based on how long the device takes to charge or run, and when the customer needs that device to be ready to operate. The system 10 is configured to receive such customer set parameters in order to set the appropriate Priority and base load connection. According to certain embodiments, all Priority may be over-ridden by the customer at any time, thereby allowing the load to connect whether or not there is a possible overload situation. In some embodiments, a Waiting Mode Alarm may be employed to provide an electronic notice to the utility when a Waiting Mode event takes place. On the other hand, a Low Voltage Alarm is a setpoint used to notify the utility when the customer service Voltage or utilization Voltage drops below a predetermined threshold. The Low Voltage Alarm may interface with Smart Meter data in order to determine the service Voltage. As set forth above, another aspect of the system 10 may comprise a transformer Busy Signal, which may be used to communicate to a customer that it is not advisable to add load to the system at that particular time. In some cases, the Busy Signal may be sent to the customer when the transformer load has reached a point of maximum desired capacity. In further embodiments of the invention, the system 10 may be adapted to be used in connection with Revenue Protection. Specifically, the system 10 may be used in combination with Smart Meter load profile data in order to observe any imbalance of load profiles, thereby locating areas in which various parties may be stealing power. Yet another application for the invention involves a microgrid setting, wherein a small portion of a circuit is islanded in order to isolate it from any adverse circumstances. According to such an application, be customer's distributed generation may be balanced with the customer load in such a way that the distribution transformer can be cut off from the primary electrical system, thus remaining energized during an outage elsewhere on the circuit.
