A photovoltaic (PV) power generation system is described. The system includes at least one PV module comprising a plurality of PV cells, a plurality of sensors, and a processing device communicatively coupled to the plurality of sensors. The processing device is configured to determine a power output each of the plurality of PV cells, receive data from the plurality of sensors, and identify a faulty sensor within the plurality of sensors based at least partially on the determined power output and the received data.
