A direct current to pulse amplitude modulated ("PAM") current converter, denominated a "PAMCC", is connected to an individual source of direct current. Some embodiments provide a PAMCC for each direct current source in an array, for example multiple solar panels. The PAMCC receives direct current and provides pulse amplitude modulated current at its output. The pulses are produced at a high frequency relative to the signal modulated on a sequence of pulses. The signal modulated onto a sequence of pulses may represent portions of a lower frequency sine wave or other lower frequency waveform, including DC. When a PAMCC's output is connected in parallel with the outputs of similar PAMCCs an array of PAMCCs is formed, wherein the output pulses of the PAMCCs are out of phase with respect to each other. An array of PAMCCs constructed in accordance with the present invention form a distributed multiphase inverter whose combined output is the demodulated sum of the current pulse amplitude modulated by each PAMCC.
