Claims What is claim is: 1. An apparatus for interrupting a photovoltaic energy conversion system that employs a bipolar photovoltaic array, the apparatus comprising: a fault detector and interrupter configured to be coupled to the first and the second rails of the photovoltaic array, the fault detector and interrupter configured to detect a condition that requires interruption of the photovoltaic energy conversion system and open a PV tie to uncouple two PV arrays of the bipolar photovoltaic array, thereby decoupling the two PV arrays; and a controller configured to, after the PV tie is opened, open a plurality of main DC contactors thereby decoupling the bipolar photovoltaic array from a remainder portion of the energy conversion system. 2. A method for interrupting a photovoltaic energy conversion system that employs a bipolar photovoltaic array, the method comprising: detecting a condition that requires interruption of the photovoltaic energy conversion system; opening a PV tie to uncouple two PV arrays of the bipolar photovoltaic array, thereby decoupling the two PV arrays; after the PV tie is opened, opening a plurality of main DC contactors thereby decoupling the bipolar photovoltaic array from the energy conversion system. 3. A photovoltaic energy conversion system comprising: a bipolar photovoltaic array including a first PV array and a second PV array, the first PV array configured to apply, relative to a potential of ground, a positive potential at a first rail and the second PV array configured to apply, relative to the potential of ground, a negative potential at a second rail; an inverter configured to convert the voltage between the positive and negative potentials that are applied to the first and second rails to an alternating current; a first DC contactor coupled to the first rail so as to enable the first PV array to be decoupled from the inverter, and a second DC contactor coupled to the second rail so as to enable the second PV array to be decoupled from the inverter; a PV tie coupled between the first and second PV arrays, the PV tie configured to couple and decouple the first and second PV arrays; and a fault detector coupled to the first and second DC contactors and the PV tie, the fault detector and interrupter configured to detect a condition that requires interruption of the photovoltaic energy conversion system and open the PV tie and the first and second DC contactors to uncouple two PV arrays of the bipolar photovoltaic array and decouple the bipolar photovoltaic array from the inverter.
