An electrical power generating system includes a spring system that stores stored energy, the spring system having an input for recharging the stored energy and an output for releasing the stored energy, wherein the spring system generates a monitor signal based on a status parameter of the spring system and wherein the spring system releases the stored energy in accordance with an output control signal. A generator converts the stored energy released by the spring system into electric power. A spring recharge module recharges the stored energy of the spring system in response to a recharge control signal, based on a supplemental source of power. A control module generates the recharge control signal and the output control signal, based on the monitor signal.
