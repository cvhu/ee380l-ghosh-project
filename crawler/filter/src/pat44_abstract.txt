A method of finding a power maximum of a photovoltaic generator using an MPP regulator of a photovoltaic current converter by means of which a maximum generator power is set at an operating point of the generator's characteristic curve is intended to supply improved efficiency when the generator is partially shadowed. This is achieved by switching the MPP regulator off in order to next load and/or unload the generator to allow a new operating point of the generator's characteristic curve to set and by next switching the MPP regulator on again.
