Claims What is claimed is: 1. A photovoltaic module mounting system comprising: a plurality of feet, each foot formed at least partially from a flexible material, wherein each foot comprises: a rubber body having two perpendicular slots on a top surface; and at least one metal cruciform attached to the rubber body; a tilt bracket attached to each foot; a plurality of metal first links connecting the feet together in an axis of a first direction; a plurality of metal second links connecting the feet together in an axis of a second direction; wherein the feet, first links and second links form an integrated grid for mounting photovoltaic modules. 2. The mounting system of claim 1, wherein the foot comprises two metal cruciforms, wherein one cruciform is attached to a bottom surface of the rubber body, and a second cruciform is attached on the a top of the body in the two perpendicular slots. 3. The mounting system of claim 2, wherein each foot further comprises a plurality of threaded rods to connect the first and second links to the foot. 4. The mounting system of claim 3, wherein the tilt bracket is bolted to the foot on top of the second cruciform. 5. A photovoltaic mounting system comprising: a plurality of feet, each foot comprising: a rubber body having two perpendicular slots on a top surface; and two metal cruciforms, wherein one cruciform is attached to a bottom surface of the rubber body, and a second cruciform is attached on top of the rubber body in the two perpendicular slots; a tilt bracket attached to each foot, wherein the tilt bracket comprises: an upper mounting opening; a lower mounting opening; an angled front edge, located between the upper and lower mounting openings; and four extensions which align with the respective slots of a respective foot, each extension having a lip to engage a link; a plurality of metal first links connecting the feet together in a first direction; a plurality of metal second links connecting the feet together in a second direction; and wherein the feet, first links and second links form an integrated grid for mounting photovoltaic modules. 6. The mounting system of claim 5, further comprising: at least one mid-link bracket connected to a first link between the feet, the mid-link bracket comprising: an upper mounting opening; a lower mounting opening; an angled front edge, located between the upper and lower mounting openings; and a mounting channel having a lip on each end to engage a link. 7. The mounting system of claim 5, further comprising at least one center panel support connected to each first link between feet. 8. The mounting system of claim 5, further comprising a foot arranged under each mid-link bracket. 9. A photovoltaic system comprising: a photovoltaic mounting system comprising: a plurality of feet, each foot comprising: a rubber body having two perpendicular slots on a top surface; and two metal cruciforms, wherein one cruciform is attached to a bottom surface of the rubber body, and a second cruciform is attached on top of the rubber body in the two perpendicular slots; a tilt bracket attached to each foot, wherein the tilt bracket comprises: an upper mounting opening; a lower mounting opening; an angled front edge, located between the upper and lower mounting openings; and four extensions which align with the respective slots of a respective foot, each extension having a lip to engage a link; a plurality of metal first links connecting the feet together in a first axis direction; a plurality of metal second links connecting the feet together in a second axis direction; at least one mid-link bracket connected between the feet, the mid-link bracket comprising: an upper mounting opening; a lower mounting opening; an angled front edge, located between the upper and lower mounting openings; and a mounting channel having a lip on each end to engage a link; wherein the feet, first links and second links form an integrated grid for mounting photovoltaic modules; and a plurality of photovoltaic modules, each module having four mounting points, wherein the mounting points are attached to respective mounting openings in the tilt and mid-link brackets.
