A junction box is provided for electrically connecting a photovoltaic (PV) module to a power distribution system having a mating connector. The junction box includes a housing having a mounting side configured to be mounted on the PV module. The housing includes a mating interface and an opening extending into the housing through the mounting side. The housing is configured to mate with the mating connector of the power distribution system at the mating interface. An electrical contact is held by the housing. The electrical contact includes an integrally formed, one-piece body. The body of the electrical contact includes a base, a mating end extending from the base, and a PV module end extending from the base. The base of the body of the electrical contact is held within the opening of the housing such that the mating end extends along the mating interface for engagement with the mating connector. The PV module end of the body extends outwardly from the opening on the mounting side of the housing for engagement with foil of the PV module.
