A data handling system for monitoring and/or managing a complex system includes computing hardware operable to execute support software products for assimilating information and/or data from the complex system and for sending information and/or data thereto for monitoring and/or managing the complex system The handling system is provided with interface software products executable on computing hardware for implementing a data interface between personnel and the support software products and/or directly to the complex system. The interface software products implement workflows defined in a top-down strategy. The workflows define data filters and/or aggregators for selectively filtering and/or aggregating information and/or data provided from the complex system and/or from the support software products for presenting to the personnel via the interface software products for selectively reducing a quantity of data to be interpreted by the personnel. The data handling system is especially pertinent to oil/gas exploration and/or production, although not limited thereto.
