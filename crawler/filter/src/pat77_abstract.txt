A high efficiency photovoltaic DC-DC converter achieves solar power conversion from high voltage, highly varying photovoltaic power sources to harvest maximum power from a solar source or strings of panels for DC or AC use, perhaps for transfer to a power grid at high power levels with coordinated control possible for various elements. Photovoltaic DC-DC converters can achieve efficiencies in conversion that are extraordinarily high compared to traditional through substantially power isomorphic photovoltaic DC-DC power conversion capability that can achieve 97%, 98%, 99.2% efficiency, or even only wire transmission losses. Switchmode impedance or voltage conversion circuit embodiments may have pairs of photovoltaic power interrupt switch elements and pairs of photovoltaic power shunt switch elements to first increase voltage and then decrease voltage as part of the desired photovoltaic DC-DC power conversion.
