In a solar cell module-mounting structure, a solar cell module 101 is fixed on one surface of a plate-shaped member 102, the plate-shaped member 102 is placed on an installation surface so that one side of the plate-shaped member is in contact with the installation surface, a surface of the plate-shaped member 102 opposite to the solar cell module-fixing surface is in contact with a first support member 103, and out of surfaces including the one side of the plate-shaped member 102, at least a part of the surfaces in no contact with the first support member 103 is in contact with a second support member 103, thereby effectively preventing a solar cell module-mounting rack from being moved by a wind load.
