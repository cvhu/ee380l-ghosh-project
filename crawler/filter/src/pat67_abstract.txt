An electrical connecting arrangement includes a locator device mounted on a photovoltaic panel for relatively positioning a connector housing such that a resilient contact on the connector housing is arranged for electrical connection with a stationary rigid contact on the photovoltaic panel that extends in space relation within a chamber contained in the locator device, connection being made via an access opening contained in the locator device. Preferably, the stationary contact is a knife contact having a rectangular configuration defining a pair of parallel end edges that are supported by a pair of support slots defined in the opposed walls of the access opening, thereby to support the stationary contact during the engagement thereof by the resilient contact.
