An integrated mounting system for communication and surveillance infrastructures includes a gantry, a system cabinet, and an interconnecting conduit. The gantry includes a frame configured for housing functional devices (e.g., antennas, video cameras, sensors, photovoltaic panels, and the like) and supporting posts. The system cabinet contains electronic equipment of the functional devices and provides connectivity to land data networks and external sources of power. The system may be installed on a trailer and include autonomous sources of power.
