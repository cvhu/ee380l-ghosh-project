The disclosed apparatus and systems are adapted to implement dynamic power control in order to condition and store, and/or immediately utilize, energy from one or more available power inputs, whether the inputs are constantly, regularly, or intermittently available, singly or in various combinations. Power control circuits according to the invention provide means for dynamically responding to input availability and output requirements in order to prioritize input energy selection, input signal conditioning, and output power delivery adapted to the application and operating environment.
