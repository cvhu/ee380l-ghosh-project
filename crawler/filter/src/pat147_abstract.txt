An apparatus for mounting an article to a roof includes a base plate, threaded stud, lag bolts, spacer, and flashing. The base plate includes bolt holes to accommodate the lag bolts to secure the base plate to the roof. The threaded stud is secured to and extends vertically from the base plate. The spacer is inserted over the stud so that the stud passes through an aperture in the spacer, and is secured by a nut. The spacer acts as a lift for mounting an article up off the roof, thereby permitting drainage. The spacer includes a recess to accommodate the head of a lag bolt. The wrap-around flashing is captured between the base plate and spacer, creating a water free environment underneath the assembled unit. The flashing slides up underneath the roofing shingles to prevent water from penetrating the structure, and includes a lip to accommodate the base plate, and a detent to accommodate the bolt heads beneath it.
