A power supply having a maximum power point tracking function that controls power switching so that a detected power value is within a reference range having a maximum power point in a predetermined current-voltage curve includes: a converter section switching input power and converting the switched input power into predetermined DC power; and a maximum power point tracking section detecting a power value determined according to a switching operation of the converter section among power values included in a predetermined power-voltage curve, and controlling the switching operation of the converter section so that the detected power value is located within a predetermined reference range having a maximum power value among the power values included in the power-voltage curve.
