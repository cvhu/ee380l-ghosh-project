A multiuse electric tile module for walling, flooring, or roofing applications having a photovoltaic cell, thermovoltaic cell, electroluminescent material, or a combination of these disposed over a rigid substrate, such as ceramic. Each tile is electrically connectable through a male-to-female connecter to at least one adjacent tile without external wiring. Preferably, a sealing layer is disposed over the electrical elements and rigid substrate to seal and protect each tile. Optionally, each tile may further include an inverter to convert direct current to alternating current or a battery to store electricity. The electroluminescent material provides light for architectural accents or nighttime visibility.
