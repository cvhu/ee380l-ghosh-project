A power converter system advantageously employs a modular, bi-directionally symmetrical power converter assembly in a readily customizable configuration to interconnect a direct current power source to a three-phase alternating power grid. Connections external to the power converter assembly are selected to optimize the power converter system for a specific application, such as interconnecting a photovoltaic array to the three-phase electrical power grid. The electrical interconnections of various elements including isolation transformers, voltage sensors, and control switches are optimized to improve efficiency and reliability.
