Embodiments of the present invention include a renewable energy system monitor. In one embodiment, information is received in a server from solar power stations across a network. The information includes operational data for each solar power station identified by a particular power station identification (ID). The information is stored in a database and grouped data groups corresponding different solar power stations. Data groups are processed using different models associated with different power stations to control the different power stations. Software or parameters may be sent to different devices in the different power stations to control the power stations.
