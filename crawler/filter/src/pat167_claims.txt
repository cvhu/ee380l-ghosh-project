Claims What is claimed is: 1. A solar module comprising: a body portion having a frame; one or more splices, wherein each splice couples the frame of the body portion rigidly to a frame of the body portion of an adjacent solar module; a bracket that securely attaches the solar module to a roof wherein the bracket is located along any portion of the frame; wherein each splice further comprises a body for coupling the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together and a securing mechanism for securing the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together. 2. The solar module of claim 1, wherein the securing mechanism further comprises one of a screw, a cam type compression device, a press fit barb device, a toothed barb device, a spring clip attachment, a through pin and an expandable section at each end of the splice. 3. The solar module of claim 1 further comprising a coupling mechanism for coupling the frames of the solar module and the adjacent solar module together, the coupling mechanism further comprises one of a screw, a cam type compression device, a press fit barb device, a toothed barb device, a spring clip attachment, a through pin and an expandable section at each end of the splice.
