High voltage direct current systems to connect direct current energy sources to an alternating current system. In one aspect, a system includes a plurality of direct current modules having variable direct current inputs; an inverter; and a direct current bus to connect the direct current modules to the inverter, where the bus is configured to operate at a nominal voltage higher than 100 volts and to operate within 10 percent of the nominal operating voltage.
