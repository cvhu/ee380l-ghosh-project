Description BACKGROUND The present invention relates to systems or apparatus for mounting equipment to roof structures. Specifically, the application relates to systems or apparatus for mounting equipment, such as solar photovoltaic panels, to sheet metal roof structures and other roof structures. Mounting equipment on roof structures, particularly flat metal roofs, pose certain challenges. For example, the mounting apparatus must be economical to purchase and be easy to install. This is particularly true when mounting solar photovoltaic panels. Reducing both cost of the installation apparatus and simplifying the installation process can encourage the widespread use of this clean and renewable energy by helping to reduce the overall solar photovoltaic system cost and complexity. Another challenge is to provide an equipment mounting apparatus that requires minimal maintenance. For example, over time, exposed rubber or elastomeric seals sitting on metal or other roof surfaces can age and increase the possibility of roof leakage. At least for the foregoing reasons, there is a need for an apparatus for mounting equipment on metal roofs and other roof surfaces, including the mounting of solar photovoltaic panel structures, that simplifies installation, reduces cost, complexity and the possibility of water leakage from the mounting apparatus. SUMMARY The present invention is directed to an apparatus that satisfies the need for mounting equipment on metal roofs and other roof structures, including the mounting of solar photovoltaic panel structures, that simplifies installation, reduces cost, complexity and the possibility of water leakage from the mounting apparatus. The inventor observed that the problem of elastomeric and other flexible seals prematurely aging and leaking in roof equipment or solar photovoltaic mounting systems could be reduced by minimizing exposure of the seals to air, sunlight, and moisture. In accordance with principles of the invention, the inventor devised an equipment mounting apparatus that includes a base plate and an inwardly threaded cover portion where the base plate is configured to receive a fastener through its upper surface. The base plate is disposed to receive a first compressible annular seal, such as an elastomeric seal, by a groove in the base plate upper surface, and a second annular seal by a counterbore in the base plate lower surface. The fastener is seated on an upwardly projected portion of the upper surface of the base plate and extends through the counterbore into the roof surface. The fastener compresses the second annular seal and secures a portion of the base plate bottom surface in direct contact with the roof surface. This arrangement minimizes air and light exposure to the seal and is water resistant. The base plate and the fastener are further protected from the elements by a combination of the inwardly threaded cover portion and the upwardly projected portion, either directly or through an intermediary surface. The bottom of the cover portion compresses the first annular seal either directly or against the intermediary surface. This combination creates a water resistant seal over the fastener. In one aspect, the combination uses an L-bracket as an intermediary between the cover and the base plate, with the cover portion and base plate securing the base plate to roof structure. The L-bracket can be bolted to a slot along the side of a rail. In this arrangement, a solar photovoltaic panel or other equipment can be attached to the rail by a clip bolted to slot along the top edge of the rail. In another aspect, the cover portion is in the form of a standoff with an inward threaded cavity for receiving and holding the upwardly projected portion directly. The top of the standoff is disposed to receive a threaded fastener that holds the L-bracket and attaches it to the equipment in a manner similar to that described above. For installations where the solar photovoltaic panels or other equipment need to be tilted with respect to the roof surface, it is possible to use a combination of the two arrangements described above in order to achieve this. It may be desirable to eliminate the need for a separate L-bracket. In order to accomplish this, in one aspect, the base plate may be formed in the shape of an L-bracket while retaining the combination of the bottom surface counterbore, upper surface groove, and upwardly projected portion. The groove is disposed to receive the first annular seal and counterbore is disposed to receive the second annular seal. The base plate is configured to receive and seat the fastener into the upwardly projected portion through the counterbore and into the roof surface, compressing the second annular seal. This arrangement secures a portion of the base plate bottom surface directly to the roof surface and creates a water resistant seal.

The removable cover bottom surface includes a threaded cavity and an outer portion. The threaded cavity has complementary threading to the upwardly projected portion 1110 so that the removable cover piece 1118 can be secured to the base plate 1102. Securing the removable cover piece 1118 to the base plate 1102 compresses the first annular seal 1120 and couples the bottom surface of the removable cover piece 1118 directly to the base plate 1102 upper surface. This combination creates a water-resistant seal between the removable cover piece 1118 and the base plate 1102 and helps to protect the threaded fastener 1124 and the first annular seal 1120 from air, sunlight, and moisture. The base plate 1102 engages the metal roof 108 of FIG. 13 in the same manner as described for FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and 6. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, the threaded fastener 1124 compresses the second annular seal 1122 into the counterbore and engages the bottom surface of the base plate 1102 into direct surface-to-surface contact with the metal roof 108. FIGS. 14 and 15 eliminate the need for an external L-bracket by integrating the L-bracket into the base plate. FIGS. 14 and 15 show a base plate 1402 in the form of an L-bracket. FIG. 14 shows the base plate having an upper bracket portion 1404 and a lower bracket portion 1406.

The bracket secures to the equipment in similarly as disclosed in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C. Referring back to FIG. 14, the upper bracket portion 1404 of the base plate 1402 includes an aperture 1408 for receiving receive a threaded bolt 326; the threaded bolt 326 is held in place by a washer 328 and a nut 210. The head of the threaded bolt 326 is held by the rail 104 of FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C or a similar rail. In FIG. 14, the threaded bolt 326, washer 328, and nut 210 combination secures the upper bracket portion 1404 to the rail 104 of FIG. 2A. FIG. 14 shows two similarly configured fastening assemblies. Each assembly shares a common base plate 1402. Each assembly includes an upwardly projected portion 1410, an aperture 1412, a top surface 1414 of the upwardly projected portion 1410, a groove 1416 that circumscribes the upwardly projected portion 1410, and a removable cover piece 1418. The bottom of the base plate 1402 also includes a counterbore (not shown); the counterbore is similar in configuration to the counterbore 406 of FIG. 4. The groove 1416 is configured to receive a first annular seal 1420 and the counterbore is configured to receive a second annular seal 1422. The top surface 1414 is disposed to seat a threaded fastener 1424 and receive the fastener body through the aperture 1412. As previously described, the fastener can be a bolt with wood screw threading, a wood screw, self-tapping sheet metal screw, self-tapping bolt, toggle bolt, or toggler bolts. The choice of fastener depends on the roof type and structure. For illustrative purposes, the threaded fastener 1424 of FIG. 14 is a self-tapping screw used to secure the base plate 1402 to metal purlins through the metal roof 108 of FIG. 13. In FIGS. 14 and 15, the removable cover piece 1418 is similarly constructed and configured to the removable cover piece 334 of FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and 6. Referring to FIG. 14, the removable cover piece 1418 includes a bottom surface with a threaded cavity and an outer portion. The threaded cavity has complementary threading to the upwardly projected portion 1410 so that the removable cover piece 1418 can be secured to the base plate 1402. Securing the removable cover piece 1418 to the base plate 1402 compresses the first annular seal 1420 and couples the bottom surface of the removable cover piece 1418 directly to the base plate 1402 upper surface. This combination creates a water resistant seal between the removable cover piece 1418 and the base plate 1402 and helps to protect the threaded fastener 1424 and the first annular seal 1420 from light and moisture. Referring to both FIGS. 14 and 15, the base plate 1402 engages the metal roof 108 in the same manner as described for FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and 6. The threaded fastener 1424 compresses the second annular seal 1422 into the counterbore and engages the bottom surface of the base plate 1402 into direct surface-to-surface contact with the metal roof 108 of FIG. 15. In some installations of solar photovoltaic structures or other roof mounted equipment assemblies, it may not be possible or desirable to mount the base plate to wood beams or metal purlins. FIGS. 16 and 17 shows the configuration of FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and 6 with L-bracket 208, cover portion 334, and base plate 214, where in place of a wood threaded bolt, a toggle bolt 1602 and wing assembly 1604 secures the base plate 214 to the metal roof 108.
