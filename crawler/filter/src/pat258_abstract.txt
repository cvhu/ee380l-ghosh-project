A method of activating a Multi-String inverter for photovoltaic generators (1a, 1b) of a photovoltaic plant (6), the Multi-String inverter incorporating on the input side a separate DC-DC converter (2a, 2b) for each generator string (photovoltaic generator) (1a, 1b) and each output of the DC-DC converters (2a, 2b) being connected in parallel and to an input of a DC-AC converter (3) and the DC-AC converter (3) being connected with an alternating current mains (4) for feeding into the mains aims at improving efficiency. This is achieved in that one or several electrical variables, namely input current, input voltage and/or input power are measured at each DC-DC converter (2a, 2b) and at least one of the DC-DC converters (2a, 2b) changing its operating condition as a function of this measurement when a limit value and/or a range is exceeded in such a manner that its power loss is reduced so that the energy yield of the photovoltaic plant (6) is increased.
