A power generation system including a photovoltaic (PV) module to generate direct current (DC) power is provided. The system includes a controller to determine a maximum power point for the power generation system and a boost converter for receiving control signals from the controller to boost the power from the PV module to a threshold voltage required to inject sinusoidal currents into the grid. A DC to alternating current (AC) multilevel inverter is provided in the system to supply the power from the PV module to a power grid. The system also includes a bypass circuit to bypass the boost converter when an input voltage of the DC to AC multilevel inverter is higher than or equal to the threshold voltage.
