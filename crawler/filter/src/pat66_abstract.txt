A connector assembly for connecting the flat conductors of a photovoltaic panel with an electrical component, such as a diode, printed circuit or the like, includes a conductor support body having a base portion adapted for connection with the photovoltaic panel, and a bridge portion carrying a plurality of flat seats with edges around which the free ends of the flat conductors are bent, respectively. A bus bar is provided for each flat conductor, each bus bar including a pair of resilient contacts arranged for engagement with the portion of the associated conductor that is bent around the conductor seat. A protective housing encloses the bus bars and at least the bridge portion of the support body, which housing contains openings for receiving output cables the ends of which are connected with the bus bars.
