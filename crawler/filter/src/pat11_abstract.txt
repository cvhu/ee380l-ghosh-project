A photovoltaic inverter control method includes steps of monitoring a variation in output voltage of a solar battery by a power and voltage monitoring circuit (51) and, when the variation occurs, accelerating or decelerating an electric motor (3) to maximize the output voltage of the solar battery (1), whereby the electric motor for driving, for example, a pump and a fan by the solar battery as a power source can be driven by a photovoltaic inverter always at the maximum power point of the solar battery.
