The method of claim 13, wherein the mounting bracket further comprises: a first extension extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the top flange and a bottom flange of the mounting bracket and having a first surface that defines a first groove sized to accommodate an edge of the photovoltaic module with the downward facing inner surface of the top flange and a second surface opposed to the first surface; and a second extension adjacent to the first extension and extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the first extension and the bottom flange and having a surface that defines a second groove with the second surface of the first extension. 15. The method of claim 14, wherein adhering the downward facing surface of the top flange to the upper surface of the photovoltaic module includes applying an adhesive to the downward facing surface of the top flange. 16. The method of claim 15, wherein the adhesive comprises silicone. 17. The method of claim 15 further comprising curing the adhesive. 18. The method of claim 14, wherein adhering the downward facing surface of the top flange to the upper surface of the photovoltaic module includes applying an adhesive to the upward facing surface of the photovoltaic module. 19. The method of claim 18, wherein the adhesive comprises silicone. 20. The method of claim 18, further comprising curing the adhesive. 21. The method of claim 14, further comprising attaching the mounting bracket to a support structure. 22. The method of claim 13, wherein the photovoltaic module is positioned within the first groove such that the lower surface of the photovoltaic module contacts the first portion of the glazing strip. 23. A framed photovoltaic module comprising: a photovoltaic module having an upper surface and a lower surface, wherein the module has a first edge and a second edge, and wherein the first and second edges are substantially parallel to each other; a mounting bracket positioned along the first edge, the mounting bracket comprising: a bottom flange; an upright portion extending from the bottom flange and having an inner surface and an outer surface; a top flange opposite the bottom flange, extending from the upright portion and having a downward facing inner surface configured to adjoin an upper surface of a photovoltaic module; a first extension extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the top flange and the bottom flange and having a first surface that defines a first groove sized to accommodate the first edge of the photovoltaic module with the downward facing inner surface of the top flange and a second surface opposed to the first surface; and a second extension adjacent to the first extension and extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the first extension and the bottom flange and having a surface that defines a second groove with the second surface of the first extension; and an adhesive disposed between the downward facing surface of the top flange and the upper surface of the photovoltaic module, wherein the photovoltaic module is positioned within the first groove such that the lower surface of the photovoltaic module contacts a first portion of a glazing strip, and wherein the glazing strip includes a first portion that is directed toward the first groove and a second portion that resides within the second groove. 24. The framed photovoltaic module of claim 23, further comprising a second mounting bracket positioned along the second edge comprising: a bottom flange; an upright portion extending from the bottom flange and having an inner surface and an outer surface; a top flange opposite the bottom flange, extending from the upright portion and having a downward facing inner surface configured to contact an upper surface of a photovoltaic module; a first extension extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the top flange and the bottom flange and having a first surface that defines a first groove sized to accommodate an edge of the photovoltaic module with the downward facing inner surface of the top flange and a second surface opposed to the first surface; and a second extension adjacent to the first extension and extending from the inner surface of the upright portion at a position between the first extension and the bottom flange and having a surface that defines a second groove with the second surface of the first extension; and an adhesive disposed between the downward facing surface of the top flange and the upper surface of the photovoltaic module. 25.
