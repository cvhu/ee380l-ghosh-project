Claims The invention claimed is: 1. A method for assessing solar insolation potential upon existing building rooftops in a given region comprising the steps of: (a) computing Global Horizontal Insolation values based on topographical Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for the region; (b) computing a Sky Transmissivity parameter as it affects Global Horizontal Insolation based on available climate and cloud cover data for the region; (c) applying an Albedo parameter for ground reflectivity and scattering estimated for the region to determine Diffuse Insolation values; (d) measuring shadow rooftop surface areas in relation to total rooftop area from aerial photographs of the region over defined times and periods of the year and determining a rooftop Shading Coefficient based thereon; (e) determining Total Building Roof Area by measuring rooftop images from aerial photographs of the region; (f) estimating a rooftop tilt angle for typical Roof Slope, Type, and Orientation (azimuth) selected from a defined set (vocabulary) of rooftop types based on a visual survey of the region; (g) computing Total Building Rooftop Insolation Potential for the given region based upon said Global Horizontal Insolation values, Sky Transmissivity parameter, Diffuse Insolation values, rooftop Shading Coefficient, Total Building Roof Area, and typical Roof Slope, Type, and Orientation estimates; and (h) presenting a visual display of computed Total Building Rooftop Insolation Potential in relation to rooftop tilt angle for different times and periods of the year. 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the computed Total Building Rooftop Insolation Potential is used to present a visual display of a Total Solar Energy Insolation Potential for the region. 3. A method according to claim 1, wherein the computed Total Building Rooftop Insolation Potential is used to present a visual display of a Total Photovoltaic Output Potential for the region.
