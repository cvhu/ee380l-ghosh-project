Solar panels of certain technologies may experience a degradation of their efficiency as a result of exposure to sunlight, either prior to installation or during normal operation. A direct current to pulse amplitude modulated ("PAM") current converter, denominated a "PAMCC", is connected to the solar panel and to a source of alternating current. The PAMCC receives direct current from the solar panel and provides pulse amplitude modulated current at its output terminals at such times that the solar panel is capable to provide current, denominated "normal operation". The PAMCC may be reconfigured to form a buck converter and a rectifier wherein the rectifier converts power received at the output (during normal operation) terminals to provide rectified, direct current to the buck converter. The buck converter provides direct current in the forward biased direction to the solar panel, thereby reconditioning the solar panel. Alternating current received at the output terminals of the PAMCC may be provided by an electric grid or by other means, such as other solar power converters.
