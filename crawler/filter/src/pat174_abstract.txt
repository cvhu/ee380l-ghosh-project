The present invention provides a dynamic switch power conversion circuit to improve the efficiency of a solar cell array, and specifically to operate the solar cell array under various sunlight intensities, especially under low light conditions. In an embodiment of the invention, the dynamic switch power conversion circuit comprises: a processor to continuously monitor the power output of a solar panel under varying sunlight conditions, and a switching converter circuit comprising a plurality of circuit operations for different optimum power conversion. The processor gathers the output power from the solar panel and then uses predetermined power curves related to maximum generated power versus sunlight conditions of that particular solar panel to switch the switching converter circuit to a circuit operation particular suited to that sunlight condition to achieve the maximum power generated from the solar panel.
