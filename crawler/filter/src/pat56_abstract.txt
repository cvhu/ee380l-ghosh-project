A method of matching the power of a photovoltaic system producing electric energy by which a working point at which the system produces maximum power is set by changing the working point in an MPP matching process and by comparing the system power, which changes as a result thereof, is intended to be suited both for stationary characteristic curves and for non stationary generator characteristic curves and to be easy to carry out so that the best working point is always set, even when the system is subjected to external interfering factors. This is achieved in that one or several additional control steps or control cycles are performed in order to track during the matching process a power point changing under external impact for a working point of even higher power to be set.
