A photovoltaic system, method and apparatus are disclosed. In an exemplary embodiment, the system includes a first and second inputs adapted to couple to a first and second rails of a photovoltaic array; an inverter configured to convert DC power from the photovoltaic array to AC power; and an interface portion coupled to the first and second inputs and the inverter, the interface portion configured to isolate at least one of the first and second inputs from the inverter and to modulate an application of a voltage from the photovoltaic array to the inverter so as to increase a load on the photovoltaic array and to reduce the voltage applied from the photovoltaic array to the inverter.
