An apparatus for power conversion. In one embodiment, the apparatus comprises a plurality of AC power sources, wherein each AC power source in the plurality of AC power sources has a phase rotation circuit coupled to a DC/AC inverter for converting DC input power to AC output power, wherein (i) a first phase rotation circuit has first three phase output terminals coupled to second three phase input terminals of a second phase rotation circuit; (ii) the second phase rotation circuit has second three phase output terminals coupled to third three phase input terminals of a third phase rotation circuit; and (iii) the third phase rotation circuit has third three phase output terminals coupled to either fourth three phase input terminals of a fourth phase rotation circuit or to a commercial power grid.
