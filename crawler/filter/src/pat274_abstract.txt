The system and method comprise a transmission element (12) that attaches to an external location of a meter (24). The transmission element (12) selectively communicates a reading signal (40) corresponding to a meter value. The system and method further comprise an imaging unit (14) located within the transmission element (12) that images the meter value at a prescribed frequency. The system and method also comprise a transceiving arrangement (16) that receives the reading signal (40) communication from the transmission element. The transceiving arrangement (16) also comprises a converter (44) that analyzes and converts the reading signal (40) communication to a use signal (46).
