Claims What is claimed as invention is: 1. An apparatus for mounting an article to a building structure, said apparatus comprising: an elongate base plate having an upper end, a lower end, and first and second elongate sides; a threaded stud affixed to said base plate and extending upwardly therefrom; lag bolts, including at least a lowermost and uppermost lag bolt for securing said base plate to a roof rafter on a structure; a flashing placed over said base plate, said flashing having an elevated portion including an upper detent portion, a raised lip with opposing side walls spaced apart so as to provide a small clearance alongside said elongate sides of said base plate, and a planar portion extending outwardly from said elevated portion so as to provide a thin shim for sliding said flashing underneath a roofing shingles to prevent water from penetrating the building structure, and wherein said side walls of said raised lip terminate in an upper shelf portion and define a slot which cooperates with said upper detent portion of said elevated portion to facilitate placement of said flashing over said base plate and around said threaded stud; and a spacer having an aperture for passage of said threaded stud, said spacer mounted on said upper shelf portions of said flashing and secured with a nut. 2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said base plate includes at least two bolt holes to accommodate said lag bolts. 3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein at least one of said bolt holes is keyhole-shaped so as to enable adjustment of the base plate during installation. 4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said spacer is generally cuboid in shape and includes a recess that cooperates with said flashing to allow access to a lowermost lag bolt which secures said base plate to the building structure. 5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein when assembled said upper end of said detent is generally proximate said upper end of said base plate.
