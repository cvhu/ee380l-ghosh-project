A DC to DC Converter includes an electrical circuit that allows batteries and other electrical energy storage devices to be charged from or to discharge to a variable voltage DC bus. This electrical circuit also enables seamless integration with other energy storage devices and/or DC power sources, such as fuel cells, to provide DC power for a Power Management System. A Power Management System preferably provides both full power source management and power conditioning. The Power Management System is able to manage power flow to and from multiple, isolated power sources and energy storage devices to deliver high quality alternating current ("AC") power to a load.
