A solar energy control system includes a storage battery, a solar energy operated absorption board, a load, a controller, a first ZigBee module, a second ZigBee module, and a monitoring device. The absorption board is connected to the battery for charging the battery. The load is connected to the battery for receiving a working voltage from the battery. The controller is connected to the absorption board to detect a voltage of the absorption board, and control the charging status according to the detected voltage. The first ZigBee module is connected to the monitoring device. The second ZigBee module is connected to the controller. The monitoring device monitors a status of the controller and sends control instructions to the controller through the first and second ZigBee modules.
