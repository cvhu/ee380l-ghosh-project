A solar power management system is provided for managing electric energy conversion by a photovoltaic cell module, supplying the converted electric energy to an external load, and storing the converted electric energy in a battery. The solar power management system comprises a multiphase maximum power tracking (MPT) module, a charging circuit, and a voltage conversion module. The multiphase MPT module regulates output current of the photovoltaic cell module to output maximum power within the high limit thereof and obtain improved solar energy conversion efficiency. The voltage conversion module converts the electric energy generated by the photovoltaic cell module into different voltage formats, such as 5.6V DC, 1.0V DC, 0.6.about.0.3V DC low voltage, or -1.2V DC negative voltage, to meet different external load requirements. The solar power management system has simple circuitry and can be configured as a system on chip (SoC) at reduced cost while provides very wide applications.
