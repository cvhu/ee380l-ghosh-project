Inverter bus structures, assemblies and associated methods are disclosed herein. One embodiment of the disclosure, for example, is directed to a power inverter including an inverter module for converting DC power to AC power, a printed circuit board carrying a capacitor array, a DC power source, and a bus structure. The bus structure is physically coupled each of the inverter module and the printed circuit board, and the bus structure electrically couples each of the inverter module, the printed circuit board to the DC power source.
