A system includes a solar power subsystem that receives power from one or more solar power arrays. A storage control subsystem is coupled to the solar power subsystem to charge a battery from the power received by the solar power subsystem. A grid power control subsystem having an AC to DC converter receives power from a power grid and provides DC voltage to the storage control subsystem. A balance of system control system controls the amount of power received from the power grid as a function of a load, battery charge and received power by the solar power subsystem. The solar array and battery may be sized to provide sufficient power under normal operating conditions, with power being drawn from the grid during abnormal operation conditions.
