The present invention teaches a solar cell, a solar module, a solar array, a network of solar arrays, and also a solar power grid suitable for providing power for industrial, residential and transportation use. A solar cell or solar module including a plurality of solar cells can be made in a structure configured to have the appearance of natural foliage. Accordingly, a solar array including a plurality of solar modules each including at least one solar cell can be made to resemble a palm tree, a deciduous tree, an evergreen tree, or other type of natural foliage. A network of solar arrays can be made to resemble a row or grove of palm trees, and thus meet the functional and aesthetic demands of landscape architecture. The network of solar arrays can extend for many miles alongside roads, highways, railways, pipelines, or canals, and can further include means for storing and transmitting electric power. In particular, a network of solar arrays can be in communication with recharging stations for use by electric and hybrid transportation vehicles. Accordingly, a network of solar arrays can form at least a portion of a solar power grid.
