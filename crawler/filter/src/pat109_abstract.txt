A solar collector structural support system that affixes to a mounting surface without penetrating the mounting surface is disclosed. The invention in the preferred embodiment includes a base assembly comprising: a plurality of leg members, a center junction elements configured to receive (a) the proximal end of each of the plurality of leg members and (b) a support member configured to securely uphold at least one of the one or more one solar collectors, and at least one footing adapted to frictionally engage the mounting surface. Multiple base assemblies may be interconnected using peripheral junction elements to form arrays of solar collectors of arbitrarily large size. The peripheral junction element is configured to couple the leg members of multiple base assemblies. When connected with the present invention, a plurality of solar concentrators form an array with greater structural integrity and less susceptibility.
