Certain embodiments of the invention may include systems and methods for providing a hybrid wind-solar inverter. According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a method for directing power from alternative power sources to an electrical grid is provided. The method can include: receiving at least two input DC power signals from a plurality of power sources; receiving one or more control signals from the electrical grid; directing, based at least in part on the one or more control signals, at least some of the input DC power signals to an output DC power signal; and, transforming the output DC power signal to an output AC power signal for transmission via the electrical grid.
