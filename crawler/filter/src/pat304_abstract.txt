A power supply system capable of smoothing photovoltaic generation output, and enabling time shift is provided. A power supply system including a DC power supply string in which a storage battery is connected in parallel to a DC power supply; and a DC/AC power conversion device for connecting the DC power supply string to a power system or a load is provided. A switch is connected between the DC power supply and the storage battery, where an output power of the DC power supply or a combined output power of the DC power supply and the storage battery is switched and supplied to the DC/AC power conversion device by the switch. The photovoltaic generation output is thereby smoothed, and time shift is enabled.
