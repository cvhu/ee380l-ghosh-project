An inverter (1) for feeding electric power into a utility grid (7) or into a load is described. The inverter (1) contains direct voltage inputs (2, 3), one first intermediate circuit (8) connected thereto and comprising two series connected capacitors (C1, C2) that are connected together at a ground terminal (14), two alternating voltage outputs (5, 6) of which one at least is provided with a grid choke (L1) and one bridge section (10). In accordance with the invention, the inverter (1) contains only two switches (S1, S2), which are disposed in the bridge section (10) and are to be switched at high frequency, as well as, between the first intermediate circuit (8) and the bridge section (10), a second intermediate circuit (9) that is devised at least for selectively boosting or bucking the direct voltage and intended for supplying said bridge section (10) with positive and negative voltage, said second intermediate circuit comprising an internal freewheeling (D5, D6) for maintaining the currents flowing through the grid choke (L1) in opposite directions.
