A method of providing power includes providing no power to an output device if the output device cannot or should not use power. If the output device can use power, power is provided to the output device from an input source. If power available at the input source would not overload the output device, power is provided to the output device from the input source according to a maximum power point tracking algorithm. If power available at the input source would overload the output device, power is provided to the output device from the input source according to a target power.
