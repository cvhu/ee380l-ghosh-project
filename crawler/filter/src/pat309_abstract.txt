A photovoltaic system includes an inverter, a photovoltaic generator with a plurality of serially connected photovoltaic modules, said photovoltaic generator connected to the inverter by an electrical supply line, a controllable fuse interconnected in the electrical supply line between the inverter and the photovoltaic generator and having a signal input, and a voltage-dependent resistor connected between the signal input of the controllable fuse and the electrical supply line and generating a control signal which triggers the controllable fuse responsive to the control signal and interrupts the electrical supply line. The controllable fuse can be used to disconnect the electrical connection of the photovoltaic system to the inverter when a switch short-circuiting one or more modules of the photovoltaic generator malfunctions. The arrangement permits operation of photovoltaic system at an operating voltage of close to 1000 V, thereby allowing use of thinner cables.
