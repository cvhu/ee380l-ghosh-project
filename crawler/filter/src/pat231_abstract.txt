A method for operating an inverter for converting direct voltage into alternating voltage, having two direct-voltage terminals and two alternating-voltage terminals, between which a plurality of power switching elements clocked at high-frequency are connected. The high-frequency clocking of the power switching elements of the inverter is switched off around a zero transition of the alternating voltage for a period which depends on the direct voltage present at the direct-voltage terminals of the inverter and/or the output power of the inverter, so that no current is generated in time intervals with a poor efficiency at the alternating-voltage terminals of the inverter.
