Disclosed is an apparatus for mounting equipment or solar photovoltaic structures to roofs where the apparatus base plate engages the roof surface directly, creating a water resistant seal, without the need for flashing. The base plate upper surface includes an upwardly projected portion that is circumscribed by a groove. The base plate lower surface includes a counterbore. Both the counterbore and the groove are disposed to receive annular seals. A threaded fastener is received and seated the upwardly projected portion top surface and feeds through the counterbore, securing the base plate to the roof structure and creates a water resistant seal by compressing the lower annular seal and by creating surface-to-surface contact with the roof and portion of the base plate. An inwardly threaded cover portion engages the upwardly projected portion either directly or through an intermediary, creating a water resistant seal over the fastener.
