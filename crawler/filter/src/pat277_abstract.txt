A topology for surveying the integrity of a plurality of capacitors connected in series between a pair of bus lines arranged to be connected to a DC-power source comprises a plurality of resistors connected in series between the pair of bus lines, the plurality of resistors being connected in parallel to the plurality of capacitors; and a comparator comparing the electric potential of an intermediate point between two capacitors of the plurality of capacitors with the electric potential of an intermediate point between two resistors of the plurality of resistors. The comparator provides a signal signaling a difference between these two electric potentials, which indicates a loss of integrity of one capacitor of the plurality of capacitors.
