A mounting support for mounting photovoltaic modules constructed with at least one glass pane on a flat roof surface includes a flexible elongated strip having a bottom side with a substantially smooth surface for attachment to the roof surface and a top side with a substantially smooth surface for supporting the photovoltaic modules. The top side of the strip includes recesses oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the strip and separating strip segments which allows the mounting support or strip to be easily rolled up. The strip segments include integrally formed fastening members configured to engage with cooperating fasteners for securing the photovoltaic modules on top side of the strip. The top surface may also include longitudinal grooves or tubes holding the fastening members.
