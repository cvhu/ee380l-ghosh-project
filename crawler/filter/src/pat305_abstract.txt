The invention relates to a method for operating an inverter comprising a step-up device which is upstream-connected by means of an intermediate circuit and is connectable to a direct-current source with a variable reference sampling current wherein said inverter and the step-up device are provided with an efficiency optimizing working area, respectively. When the variable reference sampling current is raised and the step-up device approaches a pulse duty factor value, the intermediate circuit voltage is reduced and the variable reference sampling current is stabilized, said intermediate circuit voltage is re-raised. When the direct-current source is in a permanent operational state, the inverter and the step-up device operate in the efficiency optimizing working area thereof, respectively.
