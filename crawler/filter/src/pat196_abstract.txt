An electrical connector assembly including a connector housing having a plurality of sides that define an inner region of the connector housing and include opposite loading and mating sides. The connector housing has a cable channel located in the inner region that extends between the loading and mating sides and a slot oriented substantially transverse to the cable channel. The slot extends through the cable channel. The connector assembly also includes a conductive cable that is received in the cable channel and extends along a central cable axis. The conductive cable has an outer surface and is configured to electrically engage the PV module. The connector assembly also includes a retaining member that is inserted into the slot. The retaining member surrounds the conductive cable about the cable axis and grips the outer surface of the conductive cable.
