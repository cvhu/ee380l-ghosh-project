The present inventions relate to a smart transmitter technology that provides for a more stable transmitted signal power level, a more stable transmitted signal carrier frequency, a sleep mode without the need for receiving a wakeup signal, and a universal communication interface. The smart transmitter may comprise selective of a processor, a universal communication interface, transmitter circuitry, a reference-frequency-generator, a depletable power source, and an antenna. The processor configures the transmitter circuitry to adjust the power level of the transmitted signal based on the quality of power supplied to the transmitter circuitry. The processor is further configured to access temperature data from a temperature sensor and compensate for expected changes in the frequency output of the reference-frequency-generator. Finally, the processor is configured to initiate an AutoCommSelect routine that selects the proper universal communication interface configuration and communication protocol required to communicate with a data-source connected to the transmitter.
