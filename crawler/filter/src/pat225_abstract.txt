A method and apparatus for mounting solar panels is provided. Preferably, the apparatus includes a base, a solar panel receiving structure, and a support structure coupling the base to the solar panel receiving structure such that the solar panel receiving structure is at least one of elevated and angled relative to the base. The solar panel receiving structure preferably includes a base member, a first side member coupled to the base member, and a second side member coupled to the base member. Preferably, the first side member and the second side member are slotted so as to slidably receive at least one solar panel between the first side member, the second side member, and the base member.
