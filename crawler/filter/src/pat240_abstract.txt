A grid support system for tracker-mounted solar panel array for rooftop applications includes a base frame having a plurality of interconnected lateral members which define a generally planar area substantially parallel with the rooftop. The system also includes a set of support legs corresponding to each one of the tracker devices. The set of support legs are secured to the lateral members and extend upward and inward toward one another to a respective tracker mounting plate. The tracker mounting plate supports a tracker device and associated solar panel(s). A plurality of ballast trays are secured to the base frame and are adapted to hold a plurality of ballast weights for applying a downward force on the base frame to stabilize and resist movement of the base frame.
