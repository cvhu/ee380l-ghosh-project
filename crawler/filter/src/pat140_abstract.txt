There is described a communication structure for at least two solar inverters, having a transmission medium by means of which each of the at least two solar inverters is connected to a communication network with a first group of the solar inverters each being connected via an LAN interface to the communication network, and with a further group of the solar inverters being connected to the first group via serial interfaces. Two different network types are therefore provided with the first being suitable for standard LAN technologies with rapid data transmission over short distances, and with the second being suitable for interference-insensitive data transmission over long distances.
