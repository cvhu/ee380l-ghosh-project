The object of the invention is a high-efficiency DC/DC converter, in particular for photovoltaic plants, incorporating a transformerless DC/DC converter operated in the resonant mode of operation for converting a unipolar direct input voltage with an associated positive pole (+) and with a negative pole (-). There is imposed a resonance circuit incorporating at least one resonance inductance and at least one resonance capacitance, each resonance capacitance being connected to a respective one of the rectifier circuit arrangements in such a manner that the bipolar direct output voltage is provided, a voltage boosting circuit arrangement being connected to each resonance capacitance and to the rectifier circuit arrangement.
