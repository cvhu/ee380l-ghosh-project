A method for detecting and interrupting an electrically islanded condition for a grid connected current source inverter is disclosed in which: A line voltage frequency is monitored at a cycle or sub cycle resolution. Current output from the inverter is periodically phase shifted. If voltage is observed to follow the phase shift of the current output an islanding error signal is generated causing the inverter to stop injecting power onto the line.
