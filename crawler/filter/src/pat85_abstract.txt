A method is provided for minimizing a double-frequency ripple power exchanged between a load and an energy source, the energy source delivering electrical power to the load through a single-phase power conditioner, and the power conditioner being coupled to an energy storage device. The method senses a first AC waveform at the output of the power conditioner, generates a second AC waveform at the energy storage device, the second AC waveform having the same frequency as the first AC waveform, and shifts the second AC waveform by a phase shift equal to .pi./4 radians relative to a phase of the first AC waveform, thereby minimizing the double-frequency ripple power in the power supplied by the energy source.
