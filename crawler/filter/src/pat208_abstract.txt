A photovoltaic (PV) module framing and coupling system enables the attachment of PV modules to a roof or other mounting surface without requiring the use of separate structural support members which attach directly to and span between multiple PV modules in a formed PV array. The inventive apparatus provides a parallel coupling for securely interlocking the outside surfaces of parallel frame members together in a side to side arrangement to form an array with improved structural load distribution. The inventive coupling member may attach to a slot in the frame at substantially any position along the length of the frame thereby enabling the interconnection of adjacent PV modules along both an x and y axis. The inventive apparatus may further provide a rotating portion and locking portion for coupling to frame attachment, mounting brackets for direct connection to a mounting surface, grounding teeth for the automatic creation of a reliable two axis grounding matrix, and a rapid twist-lock engagement means for reliably interlocking and aligning PV modules in the array.
