Apparatuses and methods are disclosed for regulating or limiting the voltage output from solar modules connected in series such that the voltage on a string bus connecting those solar modules does not exceed regulatory or safety limitations. This can be accomplished via a controller, local management units (for downconverting solar module voltage output), or a combination of the two.
