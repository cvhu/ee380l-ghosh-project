Systems and methods are provided for collecting, aggregating, and analyzing data associated with the installation and deployment of systems. Energy systems, (500) specifically renewable energy generation systems, are used as examples. The aggregated data serve as the basis for a variety of services that improve the system performance, improve the installation, lower the cost, and provide monitoring and service to maintain optimum performance. Finally, services are provided that facilitate the optimization of responses to poor system performance based on criticality of the failure, servicing of the system by a Certified VAR, or other prioritization method.
