A connector apparatus connects the flat electrical conductors of a photovoltaic panel with a plurality of insulated electrical output conductors, respectively. The terminal portions of the flat conductors are bent into electrical engagement with corresponding blade contacts mounted on the photovoltaic panel. A plurality of resilient first electrical contacts are clamped in electrical engagement with the flat conductor bent portions, respectively, and a plurality of second electrical contacts are connected with the output conductors, respectively. An electrical circuit including a plurality of diodes is connected between the first and second electrical contacts. In order to dissipate the heat generated by the diodes, the diodes are mounted on a heat conducting plate that transmits the heat toward the photovoltaic panel. A cover member formed of heat conducting material is adhesively secured to the panel to enclose the connector arrangement, thereby to also transfer the diode-generated heat to the panel.
