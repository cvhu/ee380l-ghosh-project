Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present application relates generally to power systems and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for monitoring a power system. Some known power systems convert solar energy into electrical energy. In some known solar power systems, a plurality of photovoltaic panels (also known as solar panels) are logically or physically grouped together to form an array of solar panels. The solar panel array generates electricity and transmits the energy to an electrical grid or other destination. Some known solar panel arrays include a large number of solar panels and may occupy a large surface area. For example, a solar panel array capable of producing 80 megawatts (MW) of electricity may occupy more than 600 acres of land. The solar panels in a solar panel array may be coupled together to form a network. Such networks may facilitate obtaining data from the solar panels, such as an amount of electricity provided. However, one or more solar panels may experience a failure to communicate properly with the network. If such a failure occurs, a technician may be required to manually inspect the solar panel and/or the network. Due to the large amount of space that at least some known solar power systems use, such manual inspection may be time-consuming, inefficient, and/or expensive.

In another embodiment, a method for monitoring a power system having a display and at least one solar panel is provided. The method includes establishing a communication with the at least one solar panel and displaying a status of the at least one solar panel on the display. In another embodiment, a solar panel network for use in a solar power system having a server and a display is provided.

FIG. 2 illustrates a computer-generated model 200 of a portion of power system 100 (shown in FIG. 1). Model 200 includes a plurality of node icons 202 coupled to a server icon 204 via a network icon 206. Each node icon 202 includes at least one node element icon 208. Adjacent node icons 202 are coupled together via a plurality of network segment icons 210. In the exemplary embodiment, model 200 represents a status, such as a connectivity status, of components of power system 100. As used herein, the term "status" refers to a communication state, a connectivity state, and/or any suitable state of operation of one or more components. The status may also include, without limitation, a network usage, a number of network and/or data packets received and/or transmitted, a communication latency, of one or more components. In the exemplary embodiment, model 200 is generated by server 124 (shown in FIG. 1) and is viewable on display 130 (shown in FIG. 1) and/or on a remote device display (not shown) coupled to server 124. Moreover, a user manipulates and/or gathers information from model 200 using user interface 132 (shown in FIG. 2) and/or a remote device interface (not shown) coupled to server 124. In the exemplary embodiment, each node icon 202 represents a solar panel 102 (shown in FIG. 1). In an alternative embodiment, each node icon 202 represents a group of solar panels 102 and/or a solar panel array 104 (shown in FIG. 1). In another embodiment, each node icon 202 represents an inverter 106, a controller 110, a communication device 114, and/or a network connector 118 (all shown in FIG. 1), and/or another component of power system 100. In the exemplary embodiment, server icon 204 represents server 124 and, more specifically, a status of server 124. Moreover, server icon 204 may also represent a status of electrical grid 140 (shown in FIG. 1) and/or a status of a connection between power system 100 and electrical grid 140. Alternatively, the status of electrical grid 140 and/or power system 100 may be shown using a different icon (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment, network icon 206 represents network 122 (shown in FIG. 1) and, more specifically, a status of network 122. Each node element icon 208 represents an associated component of a solar panel 102. More specifically, each node element icon 208 represents an inverter 106, a controller 110, a communication device 114, and/or a network connector 118 coupled to or otherwise associated with a respective solar panel 102. In an alternative embodiment, each node element icon 208 represents another component or a group of components of power system 100. In the exemplary embodiment, each network segment icon 210 represents a segment of network 122, for example, a segment that couples one node icon 202 to an adjacent node icon 202, and/or a segment of network 122 that couples server icon 204 to an adjacent node icon 202. While network segment icons 210 are illustrated in a ring configuration, this is for convenience only. Network 122 may be configured and/or displayed in any suitable arrangement of network segment icons 210, and is not limited to a ring network topology. During operation, server 124 determines which components are coupled to network 122. Server 124 transmits one or more identification and/or communication requests to all components via network 122, using a broadcast protocol or other suitable protocol. Each component that is coupled to network 122 and that is operating correctly transmits one or more responses to server 124. Server 124 thus establishes a communication with each responsive component that is coupled to network 122. Server 124 generates a list and/or a database of components based on data received in response to the one or more identification requests and populates model 200 with icons corresponding to the components. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 identifies each component via a unique identification number of each component. Alternatively, if a component does not have a unique identification number, server 124 identifies the component via a component type, a sequential number, a pseudorandom number, and/or any other suitable identification number. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 determines a status of each component of power system 100 that is coupled to network 122 by transmitting one or more status requests to each component. In one embodiment, server 124 transmits the status requests at fixed time intervals. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 transmits the status requests at configurable time intervals. More specifically, server 124 transmits a first status request to each component that is coupled to network 122. Server 124 monitors a speed at which each component responds to the status request. Based on the response speed of each component, server 124 adjusts a time interval for transmitting a second status request to each component. For example, in one embodiment, server 124 may increase a time interval due to a slow response from a component, and may decrease a time interval due to a fast response from a component. It should be understood that, as different components may exhibit different response times, server 124 may establish different time intervals for each component. After waiting for the time interval to elapse, server 124 transmits the second status request. Additional status requests may be transmitted in a similar fashion. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 stores the responses to the status requests that are transmitted by each component of power system 100. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 stores the responses in memory 128 (shown in FIG. 1). In an alternative embodiment, server 124 stores the responses in an alternate memory location, such as a network-attached storage device (not shown) or other remote memory device. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 also gathers and stores additional data relating to a communication status of components of power system 100. For example, without limitation, server 124 gathers data regarding a number of status requests transmitted to each component, a number of status responses received from each component, a response time for each status response from each component, an amount of data transmitted by each component and/or a network bandwidth usage of each component. Server 124 stores such data in memory 128, and/or in a remote memory device. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 associates data from each component with a unique identification number of the component, such as the unique identification number of communication device 114 and/or the unique identification number of controller 110 described above. Moreover, server 124 associates the data from each component with that component's icon. For example, server 124 associates a response time for a controller 110 with the node element icon 208 of that controller 110, such that the response time for the controller 110 may be retrieved and/or displayed as desired. In the exemplary embodiment, a user retrieves the data stored by server 124. For example, a user utilizes user interface 132 to select a node icon 202, server icon 204, network icon 206, node element icon 208, and/or a network segment icon 210 to retrieve data associated therewith. When the icon is selected, some or all of the data associated with the icon may be displayed in model 200. Alternatively, some or all of the data stored by server 124 may be displayed in model 200 automatically, and/or without user interaction. Additionally or alternatively, the user may use a remote interface (not shown), such as an internet application or a web page, to retrieve the data stored by server 124 and/or to manipulate node icon 202, server icon 204, network icon 206, node element icon 208, and/or network segment icon 210. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 indicates a status, such as a communication status, of components, such as solar panels 102, represented by node icons 202 in model 200. More specifically, server 124 indicates whether solar panels 102 are communicatively responsive to status requests sent by server 124. In the exemplary embodiment, server 124 indicates a status of each solar panel 102 by applying a predetermined coloring to each respective node icon 202. If a communication status of a solar panel 102 changes, server 124 changes the color of the associated node icon 202 appropriately. For example, in one embodiment, server 124 applies a substantially red coloring to each node icon 202 to indicate a communication failure, and a substantially green coloring to each node icon 202 to indicate a successful communication with each solar panel 102. Alternatively or additionally, server 124 indicates a communication status of each solar panel 102 by applying a predetermined coloring to the respective network segment icon 210 that is coupled between each respective node icon 202 and server icon 204. In an alternative embodiment, server 124 applies different colorings to each node icon 202 to indicate a communication failure and/or a successful communication with each respective solar panel 102. In another embodiment, server 124 applies a shading or another suitable graphical representation of communication status, rather than a coloring, to each node icon 202 and/or each network segment icon 210. In one embodiment, server 124 varies an intensity level of the colorings applied to each node icon 202 to further indicate a communication status of each solar panel 102. Server establishes a baseline brightness and/or shade of predetermined coloring that is applied to each node icon 202 to indicate a baseline response speed of each respective solar panel 102. Server 124 adjusts the brightness and/or shade of the predetermined coloring based on the response speed of each solar panel 102. More specifically, server 124 intensifies the brightness and/or the shade of the predetermined coloring applied to each node icon 202 to indicate a fast response speed of each respective solar panel 102. Server 124 diminishes the brightness and/or the shade of the predetermined coloring applied to each node icon 202 to indicate a slow response speed of each respective solar panel 102. In the exemplary embodiment, a communication status of each component represented by a node element icon 208 is indicated in model 200 in a similar manner as is described above. In one embodiment, a controller 110 associated with each solar panel 102 forwards a status request from server 124 to each associated component represented by node element icons 208. Each component represented by node element icons 208 transmits a response to the status request, or in the event of a failure, does not transmit a response, to controller 110. Controller 110 forwards the response, or a message indicating a failure to respond, to server 124. Based on the response from each component, server 124 indicates a communication status of each component on model 200. It should be understood that one component associated with a solar panel 102 may exhibit a failure, while other components associated with the solar panel 102 may exhibit successful communication. Accordingly, server 124 may indicate that one node element icon 208 has failed to communicate, such as by coloring the icon 208 red, and may indicate that the other node element icons 208 of a node icon 202 are successfully communicating, such as by coloring the icons 208 green. In the exemplary embodiment, if server 124 transmits a status request to a component of power system 100, and the component fails to respond or responds with a failure message, server 124 stores the failure information in memory 128. Server 124 may also generate an alarm in model 200, such as, without limitation, a visual and/or audio alarm. In one embodiment, the alarm includes displaying a "pop-up" window in model 200 that includes a notification of the failure. Additionally or alternatively, a user may receive the alarm and/or the failure notification on a remote device, such as, without limitation, a wireless device and/or a remote computer.
