The invention provides a modular system that includes a composite tile, with or without integrated photovoltaic cells, a track system for assembly of the tiles to a structure, and a wiring system for the photovoltaic tile. The track and tiles are made of composite material. Molding and extrusion processes can be used for the manufacturing of the tile and track, including the integration of photovoltaic cells. The track lengths are fastened to the structure. The track and tile have mating features, such that the tile can be interlocked with the track. Adjacent tiles are installed with overlap. Photovoltaic cells can be molded into or assembled with the tile. A busbar or wire harness is assembled to the track. When the photovoltaic tile is interlocked with the track, the connectors of the photovoltaic cells engage the busbar or wiring harness to provide an electrical connection.
