An inverter includes an intermediate circuit, inverter bridge branches downstream of the intermediate circuit for outputting a power signal, and a controller operable for individually turning on and off the inverter bridge branches. The controller may individually turn on and off the inverter bridge branches as a function of an electrical quantity. The electrical quantity may be indicative of a voltage or a change in voltage occurring in the intermediate circuit during operation of the inverter. The electrical quantity may be indicative of the output power signal. The inverter bridge branches may include three inverter bridge branches.
