A method and apparatus for converting DC input power to AC output power. The apparatus comprises an input capacitor, a DC-AC inverter, a burst mode controller for causing energy to be stored in the input capacitor during at least one storage period and the energy to be drawn from the input capacitor during at least one burst period, wherein the AC output power is greater than the DC input power during the at least one burst period; a first feedback loop for determining a maximum power point (MPP) and operating the DC-AC inverter proximate the MPP; and a second feedback loop for determining a difference in a first power measurement and a second power measurement, producing an error signal indicative of the difference, and coupling the error signal to the first feedback loop to adjust at least one operating parameter of the DC-AC inverter to drive toward the MPP.
