A Mounting device for disk-shaped substrates (2) with a comb-like holder (1) having an elongated web (3), on which a plurality of comb elements (4) is arranged at equal distances from each other. Between the neighboring comb elements (4) a mounting gap (9) is formed which comprises an outer contour having two recesses (5; 6) that are offset from each other, and a contact surface (7) and a guiding surface (8) for the substrate to be inserted into the mounting gap (9). The outer contour of the two recesses (5; 6) comprises a groove (10) on the web-side with a slanted surface section (11) on the web-side that is located in a plane (10) running in an inclined manner at an acute angle relative to the plane of the contact surface (7) of the outer contour of the mounting gap (9).
