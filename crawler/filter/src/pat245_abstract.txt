A method to clamp an open circuit voltage in a photovoltaic module is proposed. The method include coupling a load resistor across an inverter module, initiating the inverter module and loading the inverter module via the load resistor, and coupling the loaded inverter module to the photovoltaic module. The method further include dissipating power via the load resistor to clamp the open circuit voltage of the photovoltaic module, synchronizing an output voltage of the inverter module with a voltage of a grid and then coupling the inverter module to the grid and de-coupling the load resistor across the inverter module.
