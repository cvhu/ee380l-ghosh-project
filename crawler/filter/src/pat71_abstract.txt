Disclosed herein are rigid solar powered photovoltaic (PV) integrated roofing membrane and related methods of manufacturing such a membrane. The disclosed membrane and methods beneficially provide solar power to structures in either off-grid or on-grid connections. The roofing membrane may comprise multiple membrane strips or members having electrically interconnected photovoltaic solar elements. The membrane members preferably have distinct patterns for the solar elements located thereon that provide for coverage of entire sections, upon installation, as well as accommodate interconnections between the solar elements. Moreover, the membrane will appreciate the numerous types of patterns to achieve such purposed of full coverage and electrical coupling.
