A protective covering helps to prevent fastener leaks from roof installed fasteners, which are used to mount roofing systems, such as a solar panel installation system, to roofs with a mounting bracket attached to the roof. The protective covering is a portion of flat, malleable waterproof material molded to form a cover, forming a triangular-shaped structure when viewed from the side. The triangular shaped structure includes a base and a hypotenuse portion where the line of the roof acts as a side which is covered by at least the hypotenuse portion. The hypotenuse portion meets the roof at an angle. The covering is adapted for insertion under portions of a roof shingle, and extends back in a slight rise (downwardly with respect to the roof) to cover the fastener and L-shaped bracket, which the fastener fastens to the roof.
