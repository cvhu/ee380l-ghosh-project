A multi-mode renewable power converter system is disclosed. The system includes a control unit, a boost converter, an inverter and optional bi-directional charger, wherein the boost converter converts DC output of a solar cell or a renewable source to high DC bus voltage, and the inverter converts this DC bus voltage to an AC output. This power converter can be used to support standalone load or grid-connected system with a dynamic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit. The MPPT circuit detects the current and voltage from the solar cell and indicates to the inverter to provide power to the load connected. When the optional bi-directional charger is installed, the MPPT signal is also fed to this charger to make the power efficiency maximized for the system.
