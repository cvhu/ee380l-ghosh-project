The present invention discloses a system and method for mounting a flexible material, such as a web of photovoltaic material, onto a surface, such as a roof. The system and method comprises providing a first and a second elongated web of flexible material and disposing the first and second webs on the surface in a longitudinally aligned relationship with one another, wherein a first edge of said first web abuts a first edge of said second web to form a longitudinal engagement point to produce a substantially triangular shape. At least one clamping strip is secured onto the longitudinal engagement point, wherein the clamping strip(s) is adapted to secure the longitudinal engagement point in a stable position for the length of the web. At least one batten cap is clamped onto the clamping strip(s), wherein the batten cap(s) is adapted to secure the clamping strips. Additionally, securing means, such as screws, nails or adhesives, may be incorporated to attach the sides of the substantially triangular shape to the surface.
