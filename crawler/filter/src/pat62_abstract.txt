A distributed power generation system enabled for assured reliability comprises a direct current power source, a direct current to alternating current converter (DTAC), electrically coupled to the direct current power source, the DTAC comprising a reliability limiting component (RLC) and a sensor for sensing a measurable parameter of the RLC. A decision engine is communicatively coupled to the sensor, and is operable to determine a lifetime estimate for the RLC based on the measurable parameter. A service provider is communicatively coupled to the decision engine by a communication system to receive a signal communicating the lifetime estimate. The service provider schedules preventative maintenance based on the signal communicating the lifetime estimate.
