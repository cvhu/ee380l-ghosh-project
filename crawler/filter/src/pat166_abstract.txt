An apparatus and method for converting a DC input power to a DC output power. The apparatus comprises an energy storage module and a burst mode controller. The burst mode controller causes energy to be stored in the energy storage module during at least one storage period, and further causes the energy to be drawn from the energy storage module during at least one burst period. During the at least one burst period, the DC output power is greater than the DC input power. Additionally, the burst mode controller employs a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique for operating a device providing the DC input power proximate a maximum power point (MPP).
