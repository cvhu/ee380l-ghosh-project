A load breaker arrangement includes first and second input terminals, respectively, and first and second output terminals. The arrangement also includes two relays connected in series with one another, wherein the two relays are coupled between the second input terminal and the second output terminal, a semiconductor switch connected in parallel with one of the two relays, and a third relay coupled between the first input terminal and the first output terminal. A control circuit, in a load breaker mode, turns on the semiconductor switch while the two relays and the third relay are closed, then opens the one of the two relays in parallel with the semiconductor switch, then opens the semiconductor switch to break a current between the second input and second output terminals, and then opens the other of the two relays not in parallel with the semiconductor switch and opens the third relay.
