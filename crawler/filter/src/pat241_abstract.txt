The present invention concerns a single stage inverter device for power converters, comprising switching means (M1-M4) capable to periodically connect an energy source, in particular a photovoltaic one, to an electric network or grid, the switching means (M1-M4) being controlled by controlling electronic means operating according to a single switching cycle control of the switching means (M1-M4), the operative and circuit device parameters being such to fulfill a series of constraints simultaneously optimizing both the maximum power point tracking or MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) and the output power factor or PF-out (Power Factor-output) for one or more operation conditions. The present invention further concerns the related method of controlling and the related method of scaling such device.
