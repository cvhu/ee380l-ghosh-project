The invention provides an optically powered device interface module for operating an external device, and an optically powered data link comprising the same. In one embodiment the device interface module includes an optical interface for receiving optical power and data signals, an electrical USB interface for providing USB compliant electrical data signals and a 5V electrical power signal to an external USB device, a transducer coupled to a signal processor for converting the optical power and data signals into the 5V electrical power signal and the USB-compliant electrical data signals, and a power distribution circuit for providing electrical power obtained from the optical power signal to the device interface module circuitry. The transducer may be embodied using a single photovoltaic power converter for receiving the optical power and for receiving and transmitting optical data signals.
