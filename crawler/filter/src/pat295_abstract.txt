A network of energy generating modules includes a plurality of energy generating modules positioned over a geographic area and a network monitoring station. The energy generating modules may include enclosures and energy-transfer receptacles. The enclosures are configured to maintain an energy generating device capable of generating an energy output, and the energy-transfer receptacles are configured to be coupled to the energy generating device and to transfer the energy outputs to energy consuming devices. The energy generating modules are communicably linked to a communications network. In other embodiments, the network of energy generating modules further includes a network monitoring station configured to communicate with the energy generating modules over the communications network to monitor one or more conditions of the energy generating modules.
