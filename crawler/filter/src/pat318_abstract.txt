A method of power point tracking for operating a photovoltaic power plant, which includes a DC-DC converter of the output voltage of a panel having a power switch driven by a PWM control signal of variable duty-cycle generated by a PWM control circuit, in discontinuous conduction mode or continuous conduction mode depending on the current load of the converter, is implemented by low cost analog circuits. The method does not require the use of any analog-to-digital conversion, digital processing or storage resources and may use a single voltage sensor.
