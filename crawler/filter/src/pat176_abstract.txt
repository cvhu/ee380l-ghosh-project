Disclosed is a method and apparatus for evaluating a solar radiation amount that can realize higher accuracy by virtue of consideration of terrain conditions. Static satellite image data 1 and three-dimensional map model 2 are combined, and a mesh 3 based on plane coordinates is set in accordance with a ground resolution of the static satellite image data 1. A shadow area 4 is calculated based on the three-dimensional map model 2 and a solar position specified by photographing chronological data, and whether or not each cell 8 of the mesh 3 belongs to the shadow area 4 is determined. Also, a solar radiation evaluation component 6 of each cell 8 in an area to be evaluated is obtained with reference to a table 7 associating a pixel value 5 of each pixel in the static satellite image data 1 with the solar radiation evaluation component 6 in an area corresponding to each pixel. In addition, when the cell 8 is determined to belong to the shadow area 4, an evaluation component after terrain condition correction calculated by applying a predetermined correction calculation to the solar radiation evaluation component 6 is obtained.
