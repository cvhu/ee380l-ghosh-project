The photovoltaic system includes a plurality of photovoltaic modules which are connected to form a string or several strings connected in parallel, thereby forming a photovoltaic generator having a positive terminal and negative terminal. A DC constant voltage source connected to the photovoltaic generator to raise the potential of the positive terminal relative to ground potential. This reduces the flow of electrons out of the TCO layer of the modules, thereby reducing or completely eliminating cathode discharges which damage the modules.
