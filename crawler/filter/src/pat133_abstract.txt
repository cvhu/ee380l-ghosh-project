A direct current to pulse amplitude modulated ("PAM") current converter, denominated a "PAMCC", is connected to an individual source of direct current. The PAMCC receives direct current and provides pulse amplitude modulated current at its output. An array of PAMCCs constructed in accordance with the present invention form a distributed multiphase inverter whose combined output is the demodulated sum of the current pulse amplitude modulated by each PAMCC. The array is configured as a series of stages, wherein the power sources within each stage are in parallel. The series of stages provides for a high voltage AC or DC output. In some embodiments a weak power source is compensated for by adjusting the voltage or the current of the weak power source.
