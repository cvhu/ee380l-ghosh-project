On an inverter for feeding power of a direct voltage source, in particular of a photovoltaic generator (PVG), into an alternating voltage mains (N), with an asymmetrically clocked bridge circuit with at least two first switches (S1, S2) clocked at mains frequency and with at least two second switches (S3, S4) clocked at a higher clock frequency, the efficiency is intended to be improved at low cost. This is achieved in that slow speed switches (S1, S2) of equal temperature stability are utilized for the mains frequency and that fast speed switches (S3, S4) with steeper switching slopes and higher temperature stability are utilized for the higher clock frequency, the fast speed switches (S3, S4) being locally separated from the slow speed switches (S1, S2).
