A method to convert direct current (DC) power generated by a photovoltaic (PV) arrays to alternating current (AC) power using a PV inverter, the method includes: applying the DC power generated the PV array to the PV inverter; boosting the DC power from the PV array from a predetermined voltage level to a predetermine DC link voltage, wherein the PV array is regulated by the boosting to output a voltage at the predetermined voltage level; converting the boosted DC power to AC power, and disabling the boost of the power generated by the PV array after the array has a predetermined voltage level at least as great as the DC link voltage.
