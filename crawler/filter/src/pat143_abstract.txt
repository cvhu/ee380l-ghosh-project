A system and method for detecting islanding in a Distributed Generation utility grid is described. In some examples, the system, via an inverter, injects a frequency disturbance to a location of the utility grid associated with a DG generator, measures both the frequency error due to the disturbance and the frequency drift of the location of the utility grid, and determines islanding based on a maximum value of the frequencies. In some cases, the system is able to reduce or minimize the Non-Detection Zone of the inverter by detecting islanding without always relying on a detectable frequency error due to an injected waveform.
