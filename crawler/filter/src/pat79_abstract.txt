A method for an inverter, for inputting power output by a direct current voltage source in an alternating current voltage network chops the direct current voltage source by a bridge inverter by alternate switching of parallel-mounted and series-mounted circuit elements, in the form of a pulse width modulation, and the chopped power is transmitted via a transformer which is connected between the series-mounted elements. The transmitted power is then rectified and input in the alternating current voltage network via a down-converter transformer. In order to adapt the inverter to the power supplied, the switching times of the circuit elements of the bridge inverter are controlled or regulated. In order to provide a simple way of enhancing performance, the power output by the direct current voltage source is detected in particular on a cyclic or permanent basis and the switching times of the circuit elements of the bridge inverter, in particular the idle times and/or the interval duration and or the frequency for pulse width modulation, for switching the circuit elements are adjusted based on the detected power of the direct current voltage source.
