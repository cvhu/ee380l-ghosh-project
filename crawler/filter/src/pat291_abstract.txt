A system and method for monitoring performance of one or more solar panels in a photovoltaic array. The system and method includes a number of sensors are configured to measure an output of individual solar panels. A telemetry gateway collects data from the sensors and transmits the collected data to a monitoring system. The monitoring system includes an event signature recognizer; a trend analyzer; and a symmetry analyzer. The monitoring system detects events, trends and solar panel array asymmetry. Additionally, the monitoring system displays realtime graphs, proposed corrective actions, and alerts via a user interface.
