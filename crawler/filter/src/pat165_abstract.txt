An apparatus and system for preventing branch circuit current overload in a non-dedicated branch circuit where current is supplied at least in part by a co-generation power system through an electrical receptacle or outlet. Co-generation systems of this type are typically used in residential applications and can include solar photovoltaic systems and wind turbines. The apparatus modulates or adjusts the current flowing into the branch circuit from the co-generation power system so that the apparatus does not cause the combination of current supplied from the utility power grid into the branch circuit and current supplied by the co-generation system into the branch circuit outlet to exceed the branch circuit current capacity.
