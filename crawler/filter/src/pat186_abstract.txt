A solar module includes a solar generator for converting incident radiation into electrical power and a solar inverter for feeding the power generated by the solar generator into a power supply system or a load. A variable bias load is connected in parallel with the solar generator and a control device, which drives the variable bias load, detects a presently available power of the solar generator as well as a present no-load loss of the solar inverter, compares the detected power of the solar generator and the detected no-load loss of the solar inverter and enables the power of the solar generator to be fed into the power supply system or the load by the solar inverter only when the detected power of the solar generator exceeds the detected no-load loss of the solar inverter. A method of controlling operation of a solar module is also provided.
