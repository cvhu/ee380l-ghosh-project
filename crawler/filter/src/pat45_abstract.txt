A mounting system comprising at least one mounting assembly is disclosed. A mounting assembly is used to mount at least one solar panel. The mounting assembly includes a support base, a rotating base, a first motor assembly, a solar panel base and a second motor assembly. The rotating base is mounted on the support base and rotates about its vertical axis by the help of the first motor assembly, which is disposed between the rotating base and the support base. The solar panel base is coupled to the rotating base through a set of links, which transfers the rotation of the rotating base to the solar panel base. The second motor assembly is disposed on the rotating base and it provides a tilting movement to the solar panel base, which enables solar panel base to tilt at a plurality of angle from the horizontal surface of the rotating base.
