A system of electrical modules includes a plurality of modules, including power modules, control modules, and output modules. Power modules provide power for powering one or more control and output modules. Control modules provide control signals to one or more output modules. Output modules perform predefined functions responsive to receiving power from a power module and/or a control signal from a control module. All of the modules have like mating connectors and like connector wiring. This arrangement forms a system bus across any given plurality of modules, when those modules are serially interconnected in a daisy chain. In at least one embodiment, the mating connectors and the connector wiring are standardized across the system such that any module can be coupled to any other module, and the ordering of the modules in the daisy chain is not fixed.
