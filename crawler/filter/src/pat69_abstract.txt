A mount module for an inverter includes a housing element with a recess being open to the front face, for holding a single inverter. The upper face and the lower face of the housing element are complementary to one another, and/or the right side and the left side of the housing element are complementary to one another, and/or the rear face of the housing element is complementary to itself. The respective side or sides and face or faces of the housing element each have at least one connection device. A relatively large number of the mount modules can be disposed one above the other, alongside one another, and/or with their rear faces against one another and can be connected to one another in order, for example, to form a central inverter unit for large photovoltaic installations.
