Claims We claim: 1. A method of automatically recognizing an electrical system by which both the voltage of an electrical system (2) and the phase angle between phases of the electrical system (2) and the phase angle between phases of the system are monitored, comprising the steps of: providing for the interrupting of the mains electricity supply on the basis of mains electricity supply limit values, upon the reaching of which, the mains electricity supply must be interrupted, and automatically recognizing and automatically adapting the voltage and phase measured via voltage and phase measuring means as well as, controlling the voltage and phase via control means to the system (2) that is to be supplied with electricity. 2. The method in accordance with claim 1, characterized by being used in photovoltaic solar plants (1) for a mains electricity supply. 3. The method in accordance with claim 1, characterized by automatic voltage adaptation of an inverter circuit on one side of an alternating voltage that is connectable to the electric system (2). 4. The method in accordance with claim 3, wherein the inverter circuit is a photovoltaic inverter circuit. 5. An inverter with means to perform the method according to claim 1, wherein said inverter is configured to be a solar inverter (4) that is connectable to a photovoltaic generator (3). 6. The inverter in accordance with claim 1, whereby it is configured to be a solar inverter (4) that is connectable to a photovoltaic generator (3).
