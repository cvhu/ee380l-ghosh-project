A building integrated thermal electric hybrid roofing system is disclosed. The system comprises a plurality of metal battens having a longitudinal channel mounted horizontally onto a plurality of wooden battens, a thermal tubing containing liquid mounted on the longitudinal channels, a plurality of solar electric roof tiles mounted on the plurality of metal battens and connected in series to form a string, an inverter connected to each of the strings, a heat exchanger connected to the thermal tubing, and a pump connected between the thermal tubing and the heat exchanger. The plurality of solar electric roof tiles generates DC electricity from solar energy and the inverter converts the DC electricity to AC electricity to feed to a utility grid. The plurality of metal battens collects the solar energy and converts into thermal energy through running the liquid which is extracted to the heat exchanger resulting in producing domestic hot water.
