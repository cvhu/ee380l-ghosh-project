Apparatuses and methods include a solar array having one or more strings of series-connected local management units (LMUs). Each LMU is parallel-connected to one of a plurality of solar modules. The strings are connected in parallel via a parallel bus. Local string management units (LSMUs) can increase or decrease an output voltage of the solar array by upconverting or downconverting string output voltages from each string. LSMUs can also operate in a bypass mode to increase overall power output.
