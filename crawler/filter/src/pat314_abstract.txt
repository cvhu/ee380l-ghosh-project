An exemplary system for energy optimization in photovoltaic generators comprises a plurality of primary photovoltaic generators, a plurality of secondary photovoltaic generators, and a plurality of inverters. The secondary photovoltaic generators each comprise a plurality of photovoltaic generator blocks. The inverters are configured to convert direct voltage/current into alternating voltage/current. A first switching system is operable to selectively couple outputs of the primary generators with inputs of the inverters. A second switching system is operable to selectively couple outputs of the generator blocks with the outputs of the secondary generators. A control system is operable to automatically control the first switching system and the second switching system. An exemplary method comprises operating the control system to automatically control the two switching systems to optimize power provided to the inverters. The control system is responsive to data that includes detected and calculated operational, environmental, and historical data.
