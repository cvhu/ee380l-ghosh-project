Claims We claim: 1. A method of operating an inverter connected to a photovoltaic generator through a boost converter with a short-circuit switch element, the method comprising: monitoring a voltage associated with an intermediate circuit within the inverter; switching the generator into a short-circuit mode by closing and maintaining closed, subject to a current-limit mode condition, the short-circuit switch element when the monitored voltage exceeds a threshold voltage; and switching the generator out of the short-circuit mode by opening the short-circuit switch element after the monitored voltage has dropped below the threshold voltage, wherein switching the generator into the short-circuit mode subject to the current-limit mode condition comprises monitoring a current in the short-circuit switch element and opening the switch if the current exceeds a predetermined limit, and subsequently closing the short-circuit switch element again. 2. An inverter, comprising: a DC input terminal configured to couple to a source of DC energy; an intermediate circuit configured to provide a temporary storage of DC energy provided by a DC voltage at the DC input terminal; a voltage limiting circuit coupled to the DC input terminal, and configured to generate and maintain a short-circuit condition, subject to a current-limit mode condition, at the DC input terminal when a monitored voltage associated with a DC voltage within the intermediate circuit exceeds a predetermined threshold; and a DC/AC converter configured to convert a DC voltage provided at the DC input terminal into an AC voltage, and provide the AC voltage to an output terminal, wherein the voltage limiting circuit is further configured to monitor a current therein when the short-circuit condition is generated, and temporarily suspend the short-circuit condition if the current exceeds a predetermined value.
