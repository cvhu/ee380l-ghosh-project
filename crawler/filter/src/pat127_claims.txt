Claims What is claimed is: 1. A splice for coupling two solar modules, the splice comprising: a conductive rigid body with four solid surfaces tapered from a middle portion to a distal portion for coupling two solar modules together, wherein the body has a feature on the body that is tapered from the middle portion of the splice to the distal portion of the splice that electrically connects the solar modules and is a grounding path between the solar modules; a coupling mechanism on the body that rigidly couples the two solar modules to each other; and a secure mechanism that secures the body to at least one of the two solar modules. 2. The splice of claim 1 wherein the feature on the body further comprises a raised feature on the outside of the body that provides a grounding path between the two solar modules. 3. The splice of claim 1 wherein the coupling mechanism comprises raised features on the body. 4. The splice of claim 1 wherein the secure mechanism comprises one or more screws. 5. The splice of claim 1 wherein the secure mechanism comprises a through pin. 6. The splice of claim 1 where the secure mechanism has a small amount of side-to-side sliding ability after being secured to account for thermal expansion and contraction.
