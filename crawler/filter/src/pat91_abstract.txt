In one embodiment, a photovoltaic frame assembly comprises a photovoltaic module and a frame having a plurality of air vents. The air vents allow air to flow into the frame and thereby cool the photovoltaic module. The frame may be installed in-line with another such frame to allow air flow between frames. The air vents may be located within a perimeter of the frame to allow for structural integrity while remaining aesthetically pleasing. The frame may include an inner lip, an outer lip, or both to provide different mounting options to accommodate different sites. The frame may comprise a plurality of frame members, such as extrusions including the air vents.
