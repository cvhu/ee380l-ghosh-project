The present invention comprises an electrical connector device for electrically connecting an alternating current ("AC") photovoltaic ("PV") solar panel device having an integral micro-inverter to the utility grid. The electrical connector device is a compression connector fitting that includes an upper and lower housing, which each include a channel for receiving the main electrical conductor line. The electrical connector device further includes three electrical prong, which are designed to pierce and penetrate the insulation of the main electrical conductor line to establish an electrical connection between the micro-inverter and the utility grid, when the electrical connector device is compressed about the main electrical conductor line. The shape of the channel formed in the electrical connector device has a distinctive cross-sectional shape that substantially corresponds to the shape of the main electrical conductor line to insure proper alignment and orientation of the main conductor line within the connector device.
