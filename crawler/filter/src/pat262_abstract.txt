Maintaining uniform power consumption from an electric utility by a local load in a power distribution that includes a distributed renewable generation (`DRG`) system that is capable of providing power to the utility and batteries for storage, where maintaining uniform power consumption is carried out iteratively and includes monitoring present power consumption of the local load from the electric utility; determining whether the present power consumption is greater than a predefined target power consumption by the local load; if the present power consumption is not greater, storing locally generated power in the batteries; if the present power consumption is greater: calculating in dependence upon present local power generation by the DRG system, the predefined target power consumption, and the present power consumption of the local load, an amount of locally generated power to provide to the electric utility; and providing the amount of locally generated power to the electric utility.
