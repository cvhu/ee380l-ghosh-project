An inverter has two input lines; an inverter bridge connected between the input lines and including at least one half-bridge having two normally conductive gate-controlled semiconductor switches; a controller which supplies control voltages to the gates of the semiconductor switches in an operative state of the inverter; and a DC voltage source for supplying an auxiliary control voltage to the gates of the semiconductor switches in an inoperative state of the inverter so as to hold the inverter bridge in a non-conductive state between the input lines. The DC voltage source has a charging unit connected between the input lines in series with a further normally conductive gate-controlled semiconductor switch, and charging a storage unit for electric charge, which is connected to the gate of the further semiconductor switch such that this switch becomes non-conductive, when the storage unit has been sufficiently charged for providing the auxiliary control voltage.
