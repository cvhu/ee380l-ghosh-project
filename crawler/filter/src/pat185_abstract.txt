A switching apparatus for grounding an inverter (3) that converts a direct current voltage into an alternative current voltage at mains frequency, with an inverter housing (7) and with a safety fuse (8) that connects a positive or a negative direct current voltage to a grounding terminal, is intended to be provided such that a technician has the possibility of grounding an inverter appliance optionally positively or negatively at little expense, with the possibility for an IP-65 region of the appliance to remain closed. This is achieved in that a safety fuse (8), which is accessible and can be plugged from the outside, is arranged on said inverter housing (7) and can be contacted optionally to a positive or a negative direct current voltage in such a manner that either a positive or a negative direct current voltage is grounded through said safety fuse (8).
