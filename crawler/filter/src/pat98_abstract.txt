A modular shade system comprises a support structure supporting modular panels. The support structure defines a first area having a length and a width. The modular panels have upper, exposed surfaces and lower surfaces and are mounted to and supported by the support structure. The modular panels cover at least about 80% of the first area. The modular panels comprise PV panels and supplemental panels, the supplemental panels providing a feature other than shading and optionally providing shading. Protective panels may be mounted opposite the lower surfaces of the PV modules. A protective panel may so be used when the PV module is part of an installation other than a modular shade structure.
