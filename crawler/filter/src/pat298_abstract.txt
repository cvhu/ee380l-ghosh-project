A power source affected by a geographically propagating condition (e.g. a weather-related condition) is monitored to detect changes in its power output. Characteristics of the monitored changes are analyzed to detect whether the changes are being caused by a geographically-propagating condition that could affect other power sources nearby. The information obtained from the measurements is used to extrapolate impending power-output changes in the same source, in one or more other sources, or in a collection of sources subject to effects of the propagating condition. The extrapolations enable one or more power generating systems associated with the source(s) to maintain the changes in its total power output within operating requirements.
