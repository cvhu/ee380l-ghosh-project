An apparatus for providing phase rotation for a three-phase AC circuit. The apparatus comprises three phase input terminals and three phase output terminals, where a first phase input terminal is coupled with a third phase output terminal; a second phase input terminal is coupled with a first phase output terminal; and a third phase input terminal is coupled with a second phase output terminal.
