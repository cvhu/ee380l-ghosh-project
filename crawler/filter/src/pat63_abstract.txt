A photovoltaic system, method and apparatus are disclosed. In an exemplary embodiment, the system includes a first and second inputs adapted to couple to a first and second rails of a first photovoltaic array; a power converter coupled to a first rail of a second photovoltaic array and a second rail of a third photovoltaic array; and an interface portion coupled to (i) the first and second inputs, (ii) a second rail of the second photovoltaic array, and (iii) a first rail of the third photovoltaic array, the interface portion configures to isolate the first photovoltaic array from the second and third photovoltaic arrays and to modulate and application of voltage from the photovoltaic array to the second and third photovoltaic arrays so as to adjust a voltage applied from the three photovoltaic arrays to the power converter.
