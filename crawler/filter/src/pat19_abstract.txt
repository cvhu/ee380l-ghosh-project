The maximum power point (MPP) of a photovoltaic array that can be coupled to power inverter is determined. A capacitor on a DC-bus side of the inverter is used as a load from which I-V characteristics of the photovoltaic array can be generated. The photovoltaic array is connected to the capacitor, which has been previously discharged by a bleed down resistor. Short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and values of current and voltage as the capacitor charges are determined and used to generate I-V characteristics of the photovoltaic array. From the I-V characteristics, the MPP can be calculated.
