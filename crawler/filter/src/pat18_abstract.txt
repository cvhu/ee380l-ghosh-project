A sensor system (S, S') having a least one voltage generator (1, 11, 12, 13) for conversion of non-electrical energy to electrical energy. At least one energy store (2) is connected downstream from the voltage generator (1, 11, 12, 13). At least one voltage converter (3) is connected to the energy store (2) such that its output signal is suitable for operation of a processor controller (4). At least one sensor (7, 71) is provided, and at least one transmitter (5) enables wire-free transmission of transmission messages which can be produced by the processor controller (4) and which contain at least one measured value from the at least one sensor (7, 71). A timer circuit (6) is provided, which can be triggered as a function of a voltage level of the at least one energy store (2), and which activates the sensor system (S) in order to transmit at least one transmission message after a specific time interval.
