A system is provided for maximizing solar energy utilization by moving a solar panel to track movement of the sun from sunrise to sunset. Preferably, the solar panel is inclined from the horizontal plane by a fixed angle of about ten degrees. And, movements of the solar panel are accomplished, daily, in accordance with a programmed schedule of consecutive cycles. In this schedule, each cycle has a start time (i.e. sunrise) and a start point that is determined by the sun's direction from the solar panel.
