A solar generator distributively performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) has a plurality of solar cell modules formed by electrically connecting multiple solar cells, and a power conversion and transmission unit electrically connected with two power output terminals of the solar cell module. Each of the solar cells has a solar chip having two DC power output terminals and an MPPT unit having two power input terminals electrically connected with the two DC power output terminals, and two power output terminals. The solar generator performs MPPT associated with each solar cell, thereby ensuring the output power of the entire system a maximum power. When performing MPPT in a conventional inverter, maximum power of each solar cell is effectively acquired.
