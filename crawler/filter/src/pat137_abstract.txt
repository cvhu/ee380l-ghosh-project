An integrated voltaic energy system incorporates a bio-friendly DC power generator with a photovoltaic (PV) system connected to feed a main service panel and a utility grid. A plurality of inverters are connected one each, to a respective output of one of a plurality of photovoltaic (PV) solar arrays. The outputs of each of the inverters are connected to a main service panel and a utility grid. A further inverter is connected to the DC power generator and in parallel with the other inverters. The DC power generator is also connected to each of the PV solar panel inverters through a switch operated at a specific time manually or automatically. When switched the DC power generator feeds all of the inverters. A resistor/capacitor structure is connected between the DC power generator and each inverter. A self-powered timer may control the output level of the DC power generator.
