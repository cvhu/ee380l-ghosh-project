Claims I claim: 1. A system for measuring the power from an at-premise renewable Power System as it is generated at a consumer's premises, said system comprising: at least one at-premise renewable power system provided at no cost to said consumer, wherein said at-premise renewable power system is at least partially powered by at least one alternate energy source; at least one meter in communication with each said at least one at-premise renewable power system, wherein said at least one meter measures usage by each said at-premise renewable power system; at least one data hub; at least one computer processor implemented data server in communication with each said at least one data hub; at least two communication nodes in communication with each said meter, wherein each said communication node transmits said usage to said at least one data hub, and each said at least on data hub transmits said usage to said at least one server and said at least one computer processor implemented data server calculates the utilized generation of said at-premise renewable power system and bills the consumer according to said utilized generation. 2. A system as in claim 1, further comprising at least one wireless communication node and a data storage means for storing usage information. 3. A system as in claim 1, further comprising: At least one secondary energy source in communication with and at least partially powering said at least one at-premise renewable power system. 4. A system as in claim 1, wherein said at least one meter is selected from the group consisting of pulse meter, temperature meter, electromechincal meter, solid state meter, flow meter, electric meter, energy meter and watt meter.
