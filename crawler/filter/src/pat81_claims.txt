Claims I claim: 1. A computer processor implemented method of measuring, monitoring, comparing and diagnosing the power generated of at least two renewable power systems provided to a consumer, said method comprising the steps of; providing at least two renewable power systems, at least one data server, at least one generation monitoring device in communication with at least one said renewable power system and at least one communication node in communication with at least one of said renewable power system, said generation monitoring device and said data server, determining at least one diagnostic variable for each said renewable power system and saving each said at least one diagnostic variable into said at least one data server; determining at least one system coefficient for each said renewable power system and saving each said at least one system coefficient in said at least one data server; determining the energy generated by each said renewable power system and saving said energy generated in said at least one data server; wherein said at least one data server determines comparative information based upon at least one of a background constant, said diagnostic variable, said system coefficient and said energy generated to determine a comparative value of said renewable power system; wherein said comparative information is a geographic average and wherein said geographic average is determined by: randomly selecting a predetermined number of renewable power systems; determining the normalized performance of each said renewable power systems, summing said normalized performances to provide a sum and dividing said sum by said predetermined number to provide a geographic average; and saving said geographic average in said data server. 2. A computer processor implemented method of measuring, monitoring, comparing and diagnosing the power generated of at least two renewable power systems provided to a consumer, said method comprising the steps of; providing at least two renewable power systems, at least one data server, at least one generation monitoring device in communication with at least one said renewable power system and at least one communication node in communication with at least one of said renewable power system, said generation monitoring device and said data server, determining at least one diagnostic variable for each said renewable power system and saving each said at least one diagnostic variable into said at least one data server; determining at least one system coefficient for each said renewable power system and saving each said at least one system coefficient in said at least one data server; determining the energy generated by each said renewable power system and saving said energy generated in said at least one data server; wherein said at least one data server determines comparative information based upon at least one of a background constant, said diagnostic variable, said system coefficient and said energy generated to determine a comparative value of said renewable power system; wherein said comparative information is a comparative diagnostic and wherein said comparative diagnostic is determined by: determining a geographic average performance; comparing at least one renewable power systems performance to said geographic average performance; alerting at least one user when said at least one renewable power systems performance is a predetermined amount lower than said geographic average performance. 3. A method as in claim 2, further comprising the steps of: determining if said at least one renewable power system can be remotely adjusted; remotely making a change to said at least one renewable power system. 4. A method as in claim 3, loading background constants and diagnostic variables into said data server. 5. A system for measuring, monitoring, comparing and diagnosing the power generated from at least two renewable power systems as it is generated at a consumer's premises, said system comprising: at least two renewable power systems; at least one generation monitoring device, wherein said at least one generation monitoring device calculates the energy generated at each said consumer's premises by said renewable power system; at least one communication node in communication with each said at least one generation monitoring device: at least one data server in communication with each said at least one communication node, wherein said at least one data server accepts information from at least one said communication node to determine the power generated at a first user's premises and compare said power generated at a first user's premises to comparative information obtained from at least two renewable power systems to determine if said first user's renewable power system is within a predetermined deviation from said comparative information; wherein said comparative information is a geographic average and said geographic average is determined by: selecting a predetermined number of at premise renewable power systems; determining the normalized performance of each said at premise renewable power systems, summing said normalized performances to provide a sum and dividing said sum by said predetermined number to provide a geographic average; and saving said geographic average in said data server. 6. A system for measuring, monitoring, comparing and diagnosing the power generated from at least two renewable power systems as it is generated at a consumer's premises, said system comprising: at least two renewable power systems; at least one generation monitoring device, wherein said at least one generation monitoring device calculates the energy generated at each said consumer's premises by said renewable power system; at least one communication node in communication with each said at least one generation monitoring device: at least one data server in communication with each said at least one communication node, wherein said at least one data server accepts information from at least one said communication node to determine the power generated at a first user's premises and compare said power generated at a first user's premises to comparative information obtained from at least two renewable power systems to determine if said first user's renewable power system is within a predetermined deviation from said comparative information; wherein said comparative information is a comparative diagnostic and said comparative diagnostic is determined by: determining a geographic average performance; comparing at least one renewable power systems performance to said geographic average performance; alerting at least one user when said at least one renewable power systems performance is a predetermined amount lower than said geographic average performance.
