Means for connecting a local electrical power source to the wiring of a building wiring. A branch circuit monitor module can be installed as part of a branch circuit that includes a circuit breaker and a power receptacle and having safe operating ranges for current and voltage carried by the branch circuit. The branch circuit monitor module can measure data representative of one or more of voltage, current, and current flow direction in the branch circuit between the circuit breaker and the power receptacle and outputs the data. A communications and control module can receive the data and in response presents control commands to a local power source, the control commands causing the local power source to modify its power output such that the branch circuit stays within the safe operating ranges. Related systems, apparatus, methods, and/or articles are also described.
