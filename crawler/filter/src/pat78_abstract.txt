A system and method of predicting power events in intermittent power environments and dispatching computational operations of an integrated circuit accordingly. A power management prediction system includes a controller executing a prediction algorithm, an arrangement of computation circuitry, a non-volatile storage device containing a power requirements log and a power history log, a clock generator, an intermittent power source, and a power monitor circuit. A method of predicting intermittent power events and dispatching computational operations includes: storing power requirements of each computational operation, monitoring the intermittent power source to generate a history log, predicting a subsequent power event based on the history log, retrieving actual power requirements of one or more computational operations, comparing the predicted power event with actual power requirements, determining whether actual power requirements are satisfied, dispatching one or more computational operations that correspond to one or more actual power events, or performing an error recovery operation.
