A solar receiver can have a base plate having a first surface and a second surface, a plurality of solar cells positioned over and supported by the first surface of the base plate, each solar cell having a cell face suitable for receiving solar radiation that faces away from the base plate, the plurality of solar cells being arranged in at least one string having a string axis, and a plurality of fins attached directly to the second surface of the base plate, wherein the fins extend outwardly from the second surface of the base plate in a direction that is generally perpendicular to both the string axis and the solar cell faces.
