A photovoltaic (PV) inverter includes a single DC to AC converter configured to operate solely in a buck mode for PV array voltage levels greater than a connected power grid instantaneous voltage plus converter margin, and further configured to operate solely in a boost mode for PV array voltage levels plus margin less than the connected power grid instantaneous voltage, such that the PV inverter generates a rectified sine wave current in response to the available PV array power, and further such that the PV inverter generates a utility grid current in response to the rectified sine wave current.
