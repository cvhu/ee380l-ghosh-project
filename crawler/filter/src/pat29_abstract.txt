The object of the invention is a protective device for a load carrying apparatus for preventing or reducing an electric arc during separation of the load current carrying plug connectors (2) using a switch (7) that reduces the load current to such an extent that the load current that remains is harmless, with a protective cover (5) for the load current plug connectors (2), said cover being securable to the apparatus and making it more difficult to remove the load current plug connectors (2) as long as it is secured to the apparatus, said protective cover (5) comprising a means that is operably connected to the switch in such a manner that the load current is reduced by the switch (7) when the protective cover is removed from the apparatus, said protective cover (5) comprising electrical contacts (10) for an electrical means and for electrical connection to additional contacts on the apparatus so that the contacts (10) of the protective cover (5) are separated from the additional contacts (11) and the load current is reduced when the protective cover is being removed.
