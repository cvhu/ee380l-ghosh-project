Certain embodiments of the invention may include systems and methods for controlling power in renewable solar energy sources. According to an example embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for controlling a renewable energy solar farm, where the farm may include one or more renewable energy sources. The method may include measuring aggregate energy output of the renewable energy solar farm and measuring individual source energy output of the one or more renewable energy sources. The method may also include controlling energy production from the one or more renewable energy sources via a controller based at least in part on the measured aggregate energy output and the measured individual source energy output, where the controller facilitates communications with the one or more renewable energy sources.
