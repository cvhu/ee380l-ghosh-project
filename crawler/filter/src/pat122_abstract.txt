The invention relates to a frame assembly for mounting solar modules (1), said frame assembly comprising at least two flat frames which are arranged at a distance, preferably forming a triangle respectively with the frame sides (2, 3, 4) thereof, respectively one frame side (4) being inclined in relation to the surface of the ground or the roof (5). Carrier profiled parts (6, 7) which can be respectively displaced and fixed and are used to support and fix a solar module (1) are respectively arranged on two adjacent frames on the inclined side (4) of the frame. The carrier profiled parts (6, 7) are used to ensure the connection to the adjacently arranged frame sides (2, 3) in such a way that they can be displaced and fixed in relation to each other. The frame sides (2, 3) are also connected in such a way that they can be displaced and fixed in relation to each other and/or comprise at least one length adjustment device.
