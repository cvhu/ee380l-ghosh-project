A multiple bi-directional input/output power control system includes a network of functional blocks housed in a single enclosure, providing DC power to one or more DC loads, and providing control and internal pathways, sharing one or more AC and/or DC power inputs. The system feeds back AC power from the DC power source into an AC input connection, and the fed-back AC power is shared by other AC loads. The system operates at least one alternative source of DC in a dynamic manner, allowing maximization of power generating capability at respective specific operating conditions of the moment. Power isolation may be handled by an AC isolation block right at a power input. Therefore all other blocks within a multi-function power control unit (MFPCU) are isolated from AC ground.
