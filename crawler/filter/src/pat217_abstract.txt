A system for assisting solar power generation contains several racks for fastening power conversion modules. The racks each have a pivot axis and are mounted for pivotal movement about the pivot axis. The racks each have a lever, a movement of the lever causing a respective one of the racks to pivot. A coupling rod is provided on which the levers are each carried for rotation. The coupling rod couple the levers of the racks together and are further coupled to a linear drive unit so that the racks may be caused to pivot together through an action of the linear drive unit. A common mounting configuration mounts the racks so as to have the pivot axis carried on the common mounting configuration. The linear drive unit has a first end hinge-linked to the common mounting configuration and a second end hinge-linked to the coupling rod.
