Claims What is claimed is: 1. An electrical connector arrangement for connecting an insulated electrical conductor (17) to the rigid contact (2) of a photovoltaic panel (1), comprising: (a) a photovoltaic panel (1) having a horizontal planar upper surface (1a); (b) a conductive strip (3) mounted on and in electrical engagement with said panel upper surface, said conductive strip having at least one rigid stationary contact (2) extending upwardly from and normal to said conductive strip; (c) a connector housing (9) having a bottom wall containing a chamber, said housing including a generally vertical wall portion containing at least one conductor access opening (9a) in communication with said chamber; (d) at least one resilient contact (14) mounted in said housing chamber, said resilient contact being adapted for electrical connection with one end of a conductor introduced into said chamber via said conductor opening; and (e) mounting means for mounting said connector housing on said photovoltaic panel with said resilient contact in electrical engagement with said stationary contact. 2. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 1, wherein said mounting means includes an inverted generally-rectangular dish-shaped mounting member (4) mounted on said conductive strip, said mounting member containing a chamber receiving in spaced relation said stationary contact, said mounting member having a horizontal top surface (4a) containing an access opening (5) arranged above said stationary contact and through which said resilient contact extends. 3. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, and further including first locator means (7) extending upwardly from said mounting member for cooperation with second locator means (8) associated with said connector housing for positioning said housing at a mounted position relative to said photovoltaic panel in which said resilient contact is in alignment with said stationary contact. 4. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 3, wherein said first locator means comprises a vertical locator pin (7) having a lower end portion provided with a downwardly directed projection (10) that extends within a support opening (11) contained in said mounting member top surface. 5. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 4, where said locator pin has an upper end that extends within a locator opening (8) contained in the bottom of said connector housing, said locator pin and said locator opening having corresponding non-circular cross-sectional configurations. 6. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 4, wherein said stationary contact is a generally rectangular knife contact (2) having a horizontal upper edge; and further wherein the lower extremity of said locator pin projection contains a slot (12) that receives an intermediate portion (13) of said knife contact upper edge. 7. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 4, wherein said connector housing is provided with a pair of said resilient contacts (14) arranged on opposite sides of said locator pin for engagement via a corresponding pair of said access openings with portions of said stationary contact upper edge on opposite sides of said knife contact intermediate portion. 8. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 7, wherein said housing contains a pair of conductor openings (9a) communicating with said conductor housing chamber, thereby to afford the entry of the ends of a pair of conductors into said housing chamber for connection with said resilient contacts, respectively. 9. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, wherein said stationary contact is a rectangular knife contact having vertical end edges that are supported in a pair of vertical support slots (6) contained in opposed walls of said mounting member access opening. 10. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, wherein said housing has at its lower edge a peripheral horizontal flange portion (15) seated on said photovoltaic panel upper surface. 11. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 10, wherein said connector housing has an inverted generally dish-shaped configuration. 12. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, wherein said mounting member is adhesively fastened to said conductive strip. 13. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, wherein said stationary contact is preformed on said conductive strip prior to the lamination of said conductive strip to said panel upper surface. 14. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 3, wherein said first locator means comprises a locator pin integrally molded with said mounting member, said locator pin extending vertically upwardly from said mounting member; and further wherein said second locator means comprises a locator opening contained in the bottom of said connector housing. 15. An electrical connector arrangement as defined in claim 2, wherein said connector housing and said mounting member are each formed from an electrically insulating synthetic plastic material.
