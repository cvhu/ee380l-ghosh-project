A bidirectional inverter is disclosed, the inverter including DC terminals and being connectable to a grid via grid AC terminals. The inverter includes a first subinverter and a second subinverter, both subinverters being connected in parallel to the DC terminals, and being connected in parallel to the grid AC terminals by subinverter AC terminals. Each subinverter includes a full bridge and a switchable freewheel path, both being configured to drive current between the grid AC terminals in a driving direction, and configured to block a current between the grid AC terminals in a blocking direction opposite the driving direction. The driving direction of the first subinverter is the blocking direction of the second subinverter.
