A system and method for installing a solar module on a roof using a mounting structure which can be adjusted after it has been fixed to the roof. The mounting structure is comprised of a plate having a slot into which an adjustable bracket is slidably positioned. The mounting structures are spaced from each other and the plates are fixed to the roof by toggle bolts or the like. A framed module is placed across the structures and one or both of the adjustable brackets are adjusted to align holes in the frame of the module with threaded chambers in the brackets. Next, threaded fasteners are passed through the holes and into the chambers to thereby secure the solar module to the roof.
