The coupling arrangement (3) is arranged functionally between the PV generators (9, 11) and the inverter (4) and designed to connect the PV generators selectively either in a series circuit arrangement or a parallel circuit arrangement to the inverter (4). The PV system (1) can therefore expediently be operated with an intermediate circuit voltage which is higher than the maximum voltage of one PV generator for achieving improved efficiency whereas it can be switched to a lower intermediate circuit voltage when necessary, for example, in case of a ground connection fault, to maintain predetermined voltage limits.",,Device to manage power from PV cell to inverter,http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=99&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=inverter.CLM.&s2=photovoltaic.CLM.&co1=AND&p=2&OS=ACLM/inverter+AND+ACLM/photovoltaic&RS=ACLM/inverter+AND+ACLM/photovoltaic,,,,"[0001] This application claims the priority of German Application No. 10 2010 026 778.3 filed Jul. 9, 2010.",Application Search, Inverter (claims) Photovoltaic (claims),Utility,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,
