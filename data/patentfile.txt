<BR><BR> The field to which the disclosure generally relates includes hydrogen generation by electrolyzers, and more specifically, reducing the cost of renewable hydrogen generation.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Hydrogen generation devices use electricity to produce hydrogen (and oxygen) by electrolysis of water in an electrolyzer.  The hydrogen generated is stored for use as a fuel, useable in fuel cells and internal combustion engines.  The oxygen is
vented to the atmosphere.  Electrolyzers may be powered by solar energy.  Solar hydrogen generation by a photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-electrolyzer) is a renewable and environmentally beneficial energy source.  Converting U.S.  fuel supplies to renewable
energy sources is essential for sustainable transportation, sustainable economic growth, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and for national energy security by replacing polluting fossil fuels imported from unstable regions overseas.
<BR><BR> It is not economical to directly connect solar electricity from photovoltaic arrays (PV arrays) alone to power an electrolyzer and produce exclusively renewable hydrogen fuel, although a direct connection method, with the maximum power point
voltage of the PV array matching the electrolyzer operating voltage, would give the highest efficiency conversion of solar energy to hydrogen.  This lack of economy arises because solar power from a fixed angle PV system is produced effectively for only
about six hours per day on average, leaving 18 hours per day when solar electricity production is too little for hydrogen generation and the electrolyzer can not be used.  Thus, the electrolyzer is idle most of the time, which increases the size and cost
of electrolyzer required for a desired daily fuel production rate.  In addition, the electrolyzer is currently the most expensive part of a hydrogen generator system.  Therefore, other solutions are needed to make solar powered electrolytic hydrogen
production economically viable.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR> The following description of embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a product 10 comprising a power control system 12.  The power control system 12 combines at least one of PV power (DC current) from a PV array 14 or AC power from a utility power grid 16 to power an electrolyzer 18. 
The PV array 14 may be any suitable PV array, including, but not limited to crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium diselenide based PV modules.  These PV modules can include, but are not limited to, the Sharp
NT-S5E1U model manufactured by Sharp Electronics Corp., Huntington Beach, Calif., available from AAPS Alternative Power Systems, Carlsbad, Calif., USA; the Sanyo HIP-190BA3 module manufactured by Sanyo Solar (part of Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., Japan),
which is available from Alternative Energy Store, LLC, Hudson, Mass.; and other suitable PV modules.
<BR><BR> The electrolyzer 18 produces hydrogen and oxygen by the electrolysis of water.  The electrolyzer 18 may be any suitable electrolyzer.  The electrolyzer 18 may be a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer including an anode, a cathode and a
membrane in between or any other suitable electrolyzer.  The electrolyzer 18 may be a high-pressure electrolyzer.
<BR><BR> The hydrogen output 34 of the electrolyzer 18 is collected and stored at an appropriate pressure and used as a fuel.  By combining the solar power with another source of electricity, such as grid electricity from utilities, the electrolyzer 18
can be operated 24 hours a day if desired, and solar powered electrolytic hydrogen production can be economically viable, because the cost to produce a desired amount of hydrogen fuel is reduced.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the PV power is routed to a variable DC DC converter 20, where the current and voltage are converted to the predetermined optimum operating current (I.sub.opt) and optimum operating voltage (V.sub.opt) for the electrolyzer 18. The variable DC DC converter 20 may be a variable output DC power supply circuit consisting of internal potentiometers, wire coils, semiconductors, and other electronics.  The output of the variable DC DC converter 20 is electrically connected to the
electrolyzer 18.
<BR><BR> The variable DC DC converter 20 is controlled by a pre-programmed controller (logic system) 22, including, for example, a mainframe computer or microprocessor and associated circuits, switches, and wiring.  An ammeter 24 connected to the
electrolyzer 18 and the controller 22 measures the total DC current input to the electrolyzer 18.  The controller 22 uses the signal from the ammeter corresponding to this total DC current input to the electrolyzer 18 to set the current flow originating
from the PV array 14 (defined as I.sub.DCA) and the current flow originating from the utility power grid 16 (defined as I.sub.DCB) so that the total current flow to the electrolyzer 18 (I.sub.DCA+I.sub.DCB) equals the optimum operating current
(I.sub.opt) of the electrolyzer.  The optimum current is based on cost, and I.sub.opt is the operating current at which the solar powered electrolyzer produces hydrogen at the lowest cost.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, the PV array 14 is routed directly to the electrolyzer 18 through a potentiometer 26 instead of through the variable DC DC converter 20.  The alternative circuit with direct connection has less resistance and allows
greater system efficiency than the circuit with the variable DC DC converter 20.  A switch 32 may be manually operated and the potentiometer 26 may be controlled by the controller 22.  The switch 32 determines whether the current is routed through the
potentiometer 26 or through the variable DC DC converter 20.  The direct connection through the potentiometer is used when the PV array 14 has been designed and constructed to supply the optimum operating voltage (V.sub.opt) required by the electrolyzer
18 without using a variable DC DC converter 20.  When using this alternative (direct connection) circuit, the ammeter 24 measures the total DC current input to the electrolyzer 18.  The controller 22 uses this total DC current input to the electrolyzer
18 to set the current flow from the PV array 14 (defined as I.sub.DCA) and the current flow from the utility power grid 16 (defined as I.sub.DCB) so that the total current flow to the electrolyzer 18 (I.sub.DCA+I.sub.DCB) equals the optimum operating
current (I.sub.opt) of the electrolyzer.
<BR><BR> The PV array 14 is electrically connected to the input of a variable DC AC inverter 30.  The variable DC AC inverter 30 converts the solar DC electricity to AC electricity with current, voltage, and wave form required for electricity sold to the
utility power grid 16.  The variable DC AC inverter 30 is a variable output AC power supply or transformer circuit consisting of internal potentiometers, wire coils, semiconductors, and other electronics.  The output of the variable DC AC inverter 30 is
connected to the utility power grid 16 in order to sell excess PV power not immediately required to run the electrolyzer 18.  This AC current output to the grid is also controlled by the controller 22.
<BR><BR> The potentiometer 26 may be used when necessary to control the ratio of current flowing to the electrolyzer 18 and current flowing to the utility power grid 16 through the variable DC AC inverter 30 so that the predetermined I.sub.opt is
maintained.  The potentiometer 26 can be adjusted through a range of resistance to control the percentage of the total PV generated current that flows directly to the electrolyzer 18 and the percentage of the PV generated current that flows to the
variable DC AC inverter 30.  The potentiometer 26 can be set to approximately zero ohms resistance so that a direct connection is established between the PV array 14 and the electrolyzer 18.  Alternatively, the potentiometer 26 can be adjusted to any
value of resistance needed to split the PV generated current in any desired ratio between the electrolyzer 18 and the variable DC AC inverter 30.  In one embodiment, about 75% of the total PV electric power is routed to the variable DC AC inverter 30 and
about 25% of the total PV current is sent directly to the electrolyzer 18.  This split ratio may provide sufficient renewable PV power to the grid during daytime to equal and balance the grid power taken from the electric utility and used to operate the
electrolyzer when PV power is not available due to insufficient sunlight.  To minimize power losses, the variable resistance of the potentiometer 26 is kept as small as possible consistent with the need to maintain the desired splitting ratio between the
electrolyzer 18 and the variable DC AC inverter 30.
<BR><BR> Because the PV array 14 can only produce solar electricity to operate the electrolyzer 18 in daylight hours, power from the utility power grid 16 is required for cost effective hydrogen fuel generation.  However, since the primary reason for
making and using hydrogen fuel is environmental, the use of grid electricity preferably should be avoided unless it is generated renewably.  To make the hydrogen production completely renewable, an oversized PV array 14 may be used to produce sufficient
solar power during the daylight hours to operate the electrolyzer 18 and to produce surplus solar power to be transmitted (sold) to the utility power grid 16.  This surplus solar energy can be seen as energy stored for later use in the utility power grid
like a bank deposit.  The utility power grid 16 then sells an equal amount of power back to the hydrogen generation system at night to operate the electrolyzer 18 during the hours of darkness.  This power from the utility power grid 16 which is sold back
to the hydrogen generation system is considered "renewable" or "green" energy because it is equally balanced by the solar PV electricity sold to the utility power grid in the daytime.  During full daylight, the PV output may be larger than the optimum
current required by the electrolyzer: part of the PV output goes through the variable DC DC converter to operate the electrolyzer, and the rest of the PV output goes through the variable DC AC inverter to be sold to the utility power grid.  Thus, the
hydrogen produced by the electrolyzer can be completely classified as a renewable fuel.  In one embodiment, the total renewable electricity flow from the PV system to the utility grid corresponds to the amount of renewable electric energy required to
operate the electrolyzer and to produce a desired amount of renewable hydrogen fuel.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 illustrates a combination of solar power and grid power supplying the electrolyzer with power 24 hours a day.  As shown in FIG. 2, during the middle of the 24-hour period, excess solar power (from the PV array) is sold to the utility
grid.  At the beginning and end of the 24-hour period, power is sold from the utility grid to the system to power the electrolyzer when the PV array is incapable of producing enough power.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, power from the utility power grid enters the power control system 12 at night and at other times of low sunlight.  The utility power grid 16 is connected to a variable AC DC converter 28 that converts AC power from the grid
(I.sub.AC) to the optimum DC current and voltage to operate the electrolyzer 18 when combined with any PV current available at the time.  The variable AC DC converter 28 is a variable output DC power supply circuit consisting of internal potentiometers,
wire coils, semiconductors, and other electronics.  The variable AC DC converter 28 is also controlled by the controller 22 so that the combined PV current (I.sub.DCA) and grid current input (I.sub.DCB) to the electrolyzer 18 equals the optimum operating
current for the electrolyzer (I.sub.opt).
<BR><BR> Thus, the PV system may be built large enough to generate enough electricity to operate the electrolyzer at its optimum current 24 hours per day and 365 days per year based on minimizing hydrogen cost.  Since the number of hours of sunshine per
day varies seasonally and can vary hourly with weather conditions, the total area of the PV array can best be sized for average conditions.  The total annual PV output predicted for the location and PV module orientation should equal the total annual
power input of the electrolyzer at its optimum current.  Thus, in a given year, there may be a surplus or deficit in the renewable solar energy produced by the PV system, but the long term renewable energy supply will average out to equal the
electrolyzer input required for 100% renewable hydrogen fuel production.  The annual average number of peak sun hours of insolation (incident solar radiation) for various PV systems in numerous U.S.  locations has been measured and published in standard
tables by the U.S.  Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Annual PV module output can be determined by power output measurements under various seasonal conditions, or manufacturers provide data for the power, current, and voltage
output of their products under standard solar radiation which can be corrected for temperature under normal operating conditions.  The average daily PV system output (kWh) can be estimated by multiplying the average peak sun hours times the average PV
module power output if both averages are determined for all seasons.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, the amount of PV energy generation capacity (kWh) that will be stored in the utility power grid 16 and recovered for later use may be increased by 10-20% to account for greater losses in the two power conversion steps and
longer wiring required.  The expected power loss from each DC DC or AC DC converter or DC AC inverter in a circuit is expected to be 5-10%.
<BR><BR> The optimum operating current (I.sub.opt) of the electrolyzer is the electrolyzer operating current (I.sub.oper) corresponding to the minimum hydrogen cost per unit amount.  The value of I.sub.opt is used as the constant operating current for
the 24-hour per day operation of the solar and grid powered electrolyzer system.  As illustrated in FIG. 3, for a given electrolyzer, it is possible to determine the optimum operating current (I.sub.opt) for the electrolyzer by plotting the unit hydrogen
cost ($/kg) against I.sub.oper and choosing the I.sub.oper value that minimizes cost.  The cost curve can pass through a minimum because the mass of hydrogen produced per day increases with increasing I.sub.oper, but the efficiency of the electrolyzer,
measured by the mass of hydrogen produced per unit of electrical energy input to the electrolyzer (kg/kWh), decreases with increasing I.sub.oper.
<BR><BR> The cost of hydrogen production with solar electricity sold to the utility power grid is calculated by equation 1, where P.sub.opt is the optimum power of the electrolyzer: H.sub.2 production cost ($/kg)=[PV system cost+electrolyzer
cost+(Electricity buying price.sub.0.sup.24.intg.Grid power bought.times.dt)-(Electricity selling price.sub.0.sup.24.intg.Grid power sold.times.dt)].times.33.35 kWh/kg/(P.sub.opt.times.Electrolyzer Efficiency.times.24 h) (equation 1)
<BR><BR> Using the lower heating value (LHV) of hydrogen (33.35 kWh/kg), the total hydrogen production is calculated using equation 2, where I.sub.opt is the optimum current, V.sub.opt is the optimum voltage of the electrolyzer, and P.sub.opt is the
optimum power of the electrolyzer:

<BR><BR> The electrolyzer efficiency must be determined consistently using the water electrolysis potential of 1.23 volts at the LHV, where V.sub.oper is the operating voltage of the electrolyzer (equation 3): Electrolyzer Efficiency (LHV)=100%.times.no. of electrolyzer cells in series.times.1.23 volts/V.sub.oper (equation 3)
<BR><BR> In one embodiment of the invention, solar electricity produced by a solar and grid powered hydrogen generator is sold to a utility power grid with a constant electricity price ($/kWh).  When the electricity price is the same for buying or
selling electricity to the utility power grid at any time of day, the policy is called net metering.  Under a utility policy of net metering, which already exists in many U.S.  states, the electric meter charges the PV system owner for the net difference
between the grid electricity bought and PV electricity sold, i.e., electricity bought minus electricity sold at the current price set by the utility.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, the solar electricity is sold to a utility power grid with a variable electricity price ($/kWh).  If the electricity price for buying or selling electricity to the utility power grid can be negotiated with the utility
company based on the electricity demand at the time of day, the policy may be called variable pricing.  Peak electrical demand, with a potentially high electricity price, generally occurs about midday in cool weather and in the hottest part of the
afternoon in summer in warm climates.  Electricity demand is lowest at night, with a potentially reduced electricity price.  Under a hypothetical "variable rate plan", the PV system owner would need to petition the utility to pay a higher rate than the
net metering rate for the PV power sold to the utility during peak demand times, and to sell the PV owner power at a lower rate than the net metering rate for grid power to operate the electrolyzer during nighttime and any other low demand times.
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIG. 4, the unit hydrogen cost ($/kg) varies depending on whether the power control system 12 uses only solar power or uses a combination of solar power and power from the utility grid.  In addition, FIG. 4 illustrates that the
unit hydrogen cost decreases when the PV system uses a variable electricity price based on the changing electrical demands during the day versus net metering.  The embodiment in FIG. 4 is based on a 20-cell electrolyzer operated 24 hours a day in Las
Vegas using electricity from a fixed angle PV array.
<BR><BR> The above description of embodiments of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations thereof are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.
