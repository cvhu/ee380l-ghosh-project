The solar cell system includes drive means that adjust a position of the array along different respective axes with respect to the sun using the drive means. The techniques include predicting the position of the sun during a time period, and sampling an output parameter of the array indicative of performance. The sampled data may be used to identify a fault in the solar cell array, for example a misalignment or a failure of one or more solar cells, in which case a notification of that fault may be generated for the operator or a control signal may be output for correcting the fault. Alternatively, an output signal may be sent to an external system associated with the solar cell system. Various alignment testing routines for checking the solar tracking are described.
