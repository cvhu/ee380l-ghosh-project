The roll for retrieving and maintaining the material is constructed of a non-metallic material such as corrugated fiberglass sheet, rolled about take-up drums at opposite ends thereof, and having reinforcing flanged disks in the interior thereof. The corrugations provide conduits for the passage of electrical conductors to an externally maintained control box. Retracting of the awning sheet is facilitated by means of a spring maintained in side rails that is loaded when the awning is deployed, and which assists in the retraction of the awning, when required. A cable is interposed between the boom of the awning and the take-up drum, passing through a pulley arrangement to achieve the desired loading of the spring.

When the power system operates in islanded mode, the AC load demand can be lower than the available energy from the PV array, causing the battery to become overcharged. To avoid this scenario, a hybrid inverter executes a pattern generator algorithm that varies the line frequency or voltage linearly, exponentially or any mathematical function or look-up tables. The PV inverter executes a pattern detection algorithm that detects the linear, exponential, or any mathematical function or look-up table change in the line frequency. In response, the PV inverter modifies its power output until an overcharging condition of the battery is removed. The line frequency/voltage can be varied within the anti-islanding limits to avoid premature disruption of the power system, and no additional settings are required at the device level in order to operate in any mode of operation: islanded, grid-connected or genset-connected.
