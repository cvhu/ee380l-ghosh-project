12/716,654;CA;USA;Circuitry and methodology for tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of a solar panel is disclosed. The voltage and current generated by the solar panel are monitored and used to generate a pulse signal for charging a capacitor. The changes in the voltage and current generated by the solar panel are also monitored, and that information is used to generate a pulse signal for discharging the capacitor. The charging and the discharging pulse signals are used to charge and discharge the capacitor. A reference signal indicative of the charge level of the capacitor is generated. As the current and voltage generated by the solar panel approach the maximum power point (MPP), the frequency of the discharging pulse signal becomes progressively higher, so that the capacitor charging occurs in progressively smaller increments. When the MPP is reached, the reference signal level becomes steady because the charge level of the capacitor becomes steady.;;;
