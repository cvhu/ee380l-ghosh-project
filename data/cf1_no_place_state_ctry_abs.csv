8159178,"Livermore, CA",CA,USA,"A control strategy for distributed power generation modules in a power system that varies the line frequency or voltage according to a predetermined pattern to cause a PV inverter to modify its power output and thereby avoid overcharging a battery. When the power system operates in islanded mode, the AC load demand can be lower than the available energy from the PV array, causing the battery to become overcharged. To avoid this scenario, a hybrid inverter executes a pattern generator algorithm that varies the line frequency or voltage linearly, exponentially or any mathematical function or look-up tables. The PV inverter executes a pattern detection algorithm that detects the linear, exponential, or any mathematical function or look-up table change in the line frequency. In response, the PV inverter modifies its power output until an overcharging condition of the battery is removed. The line frequency/voltage can be varied within the anti-islanding limits."

"13/068,753",(Dettingen ),,Germany,"A photovoltaic system includes a first and a second photovoltaic generator (9, 11) which delivers electric energy, an inverter (4) which can be coupled to the PV-generators (9, 11) for converting electric energy of the PV generators (9, 11) to output AC energy, and a switchable coupling arrangement (3) for coupling the PV generators (9, 11) to each other and to the inverter (4). The coupling arrangement (3) is arranged functionally between the PV generators (9, 11) and the inverter (4) and designed to connect the PV generators selectively either in a series circuit arrangement or a parallel circuit arrangement to the inverter (4). The PV system (1) can therefore expediently be operated with an intermediate circuit voltage which is higher than the maximum voltage of one PV generator for achieving improved efficiency whereas it can be switched to a lower intermediate circuit voltage when necessary, for example, in case of a ground connection fault, to maintain predetermined voltage limits."
13/361313,"(Boston, MA)",MA,USA,"A photo-voltaic (PV) power generating system and a control system for PV array string-level control and PV modules serially-connected into strings of PV modules. The system includes plural parallel strings of serially-connected power-generating photovoltaic modules that form a PV array, DC/DC micro-converters that are coupled to a DC voltage buss and to the output of a corresponding photovoltaic module or to the output of a string of photovoltaic modules; a gating or central inverter; and a control system. The micro-converters are structured and arranged to include at least one of: an active clamp device, a ground fault detection device, and a fractional power converter that injects power in series or in parallel with voltage or current from the power-generating portion onto the DC buss."
